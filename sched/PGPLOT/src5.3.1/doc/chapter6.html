<H1>Scientific Graphs</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

This chapter describes a number of ``high level'' routines that
simplify the composition of complicated graphical images.  They
include routines for drawing graphs of one variable or function
against another (``xy-plots''), histograms, and display of
two-dimensional data (functions of two variables).  Rather than giving
complete details of all the available routines, this chapter just
points out some of the ways that they can be used. See Appendix A for
details of the calling sequences.

<H2>XY-plots</H2>

The basic technique for drawing xy-plots is described in Chapter 2,
which showed how to make <I>scatter plots</I> using graph markers
produced by <CODE>PGPT</CODE> and <I>line plots</I> produced by
<CODE>PGLINE</CODE>.  Considerable variation in the appearance of the
graph can be achieved using the following techniques.

<H3>Attributes</H3>

Use different attributes to distinguish different datasets.  Graph markers
can be distinguished by choosing different markers, different colors, or
different sizes (character height attribute).  Lines and curves can be 
distinguished by line-style, color, or line-width.

<H3>Box parameters</H3>

If routine <CODE>PGENV</CODE> is replaced by calls to the more basic
routines (see Section 3.6), including <CODE>PGBOX</CODE>, considerable
variety in the appearance of the graph can be achieved.  For example,
one can suppress the tick marks, draw the tick marks projecting out of
the box instead of into it, or draw a grid over the whole viewport.
Note that <CODE>PGBOX</CODE> may be called many times: one might call
it once to draw a grid using thin dotted lines, and again to draw the
frame and tick marks using thick lines:
<PRE>
      CALL PGSLW(1)
      CALL PGSLS(4)
      CALL PGBOX('G',30.0,0,'G',0.2,0)
      CALL PGSLW(3)
      CALL PGSLS(1)
      CALL PGBOX('ABCTSN',90.0,3,'ABCTSNV',0.0,0)
</PRE>
Note that in this example we have also specified tick intervals
explicitly.  If the horizontal axis is to represent an angle in
degrees, it is convenient to choose a tick interval that is a simple
fraction of 360; here we have a major tick interval of 90 degrees and
a minor tick interval of 30 degrees.

<H3>Stepped-line plots</H3>

As an alternative to <CODE>PGLINE</CODE>, which ``joins up the dots''
using straight line segments, it is sometimes appropriate to use
<CODE>PGBIN</CODE> which produces a ``stepped line plot'' (sometimes
misleadingly called a histogram) with horizontal line segments at each
data point and vertical line segments joining them.  This is often
used, for example, in displaying digitized spectra.

<H3>Error bars</H3>

Graphs of real data often require the inclusion of error bars.  The
two routines <CODE>PGERRX</CODE> and <CODE>PGERRY</CODE> draw
horizontal and vertical error bars, respectively.  These routines are
usually used in combination with <CODE>PGPT</CODE>, e.g., to draw a
set of points with 2-sigma error-bars:
<PRE>
      DO 10 I=1,15
          YHI = YPTS(I) + 2.0*ERR(I)
          YLO = YPTS(I) - 2.0*ERR(I)
          CALL PGPT(1, XPTS(I), YPTS(I), 17)
          CALL PGERRY(1, XPTS(I), YLO, YHI, 1.0)
   10 CONTINUE
</PRE>

<H3>Logarithmic axes</H3>

It is commonly required that the <I>x</I>-axis, the <I>y</I>-axis, or both, be
logarithmic instead of linear; that is, one wishes to plot the
logarithm of the quantity instead of its actual value.  PGPLOT doesn't
provide any automatic mechanism to do this: one has to adopt $\log_{10} x$
and/or $\log_{10} y$ instead of <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> as world-coordinates; \ie,
if the range of <I>x</I> is to be 1 to 1000, choose as world-coordinate 
limits for the window $\log 1 = 0.0$ and $\log 1000 = 3.0$, and supply
the logarithms of <I>x</I> to <CODE>PGPT</CODE> and <CODE>PGLINE</CODE>.  However, <CODE>PGENV</CODE> and
<CODE>PGBOX</CODE> have options for <I>labeling</I> the axis logarithmically;
if this option is used in our example, the axis will have labeled
major tick marks at 1, 10, 100, and 1000, with logarithmically-spaced
minor tick marks at 2, 3, 4, ..., 20, 30, 40, etc.  An example may 
make this clearer:
<PRE>
      CALL PGENV(-2.0,2.0,-0.5,2.5,1,30)
      CALL PGLAB('Frequency, \gn (GHz)',
     1             'Flux Density, S\d\gn\u (Jy)', ' ')
      DO 10 I=1,15
          XPTS(I) = ALOG10(FREQ(I))
          YPTS(I) = ALOG10(FLUX(I))
   10 CONTINUE
      CALL PGPT(15, XPTS, YPTS, 17)
</PRE>
This is a fragment of a program to draw the spectrum of a radio source,
which is usually plotted as a log--log plot of flux density $v$.
frequency. It first calls <CODE>PGENV</CODE> to initialize the viewport and window;
the <CODE>AXIS</CODE> argument is 30 so both axes will be logarithmic. The <I>x</I>-axis
(frequency) runs from 0.01 to 100 GHz, the <I>y</I>-axis (flux 
density) runs from 0.3 to 300 Jy. Note that it is necessary to
specify the logarithms of these limits in the call to <CODE>PGENV</CODE>. The
penultimate argument requests equal scales in <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> so that slopes
will be correct. The program then marks 15 data points, supplying the 
<I>logarithms</I> of frequency and flux density to <CODE>PGPT</CODE>.

<H2>Graphs with two <i>y</i> axes</H2>

<PRE>
* Example: drawing two superimposed graphs, with graph 1 labeled on the
* left side, and graph 2 labeled on the right side. This is achieved
* by superimposing two different coordinate systems (windows) in the same
* viewport, and using the options in PGBOX to select which edeges of the
* viewport to label.

      PROGRAM E
      INTEGER PGOPEN

* Open the graphics devive. The PGPAGE call is required is you do
* not use PGENV.

      IF (PGOPEN('?') .LT. 1) STOP
      CALL PGPAGE

* Set up viewport.

      CALL PGVSTD

* Set up window for graph 1.

      CALL PGSWIN(0.,10.,0.,0.65)

* Draw graph 1 (green).

      CALL PGSCI(3)
      CALL PGMOVE(1., 0.6)
      CALL PGDRAW(8., 0.2)

* Label the graph, omitting the right-hand axis.

      CALL PGSCI(1)
      CALL PGBOX('BCNST', 0.0, 0, 'BNST', 0.0, 0)
      CALL PGLAB('x-axis', ' ', ' ')
      CALL PGSCI(3)
      CALL PGMTXT('L', 2.2, 0.5, 0.5, 'y1-axis')

* Set the window for the second graph, with the same x-range but a
* different y range.

      CALL PGSWIN(0.,10.,0.,100.0)

* Draw graph 2 (red).

      CALL PGSCI(2)
      CALL PGMOVE(1., 10.)
      CALL PGDRAW(8., 90.)

* Label the right hand axis in this coordinate system.

      CALL PGSCI(1)
      CALL PGBOX(' ', 0.0, 0, 'CMST', 0.0, 0)
      CALL PGSCI(2)
      CALL PGMTXT('R', 2.2, 0.5, 0.5, 'y2-axis')

* Done.

      CALL PGCLOS

<H2>Graphs with common axes</H2>

<P>Sometimes one wishes to plot two or more graphs side-by-side with a
common <i>y</i> axis, which only needs to be labeled once, or one
above another, with a common <i>x</i> axis. The way to do this is to
specify the viewports for the graphs so that they arranged on the page
as desired, and then use the options in PGBOX to ensure that only the
graphs that require them get axis labels.

<P><i>Example</i>

<H2>Histograms</H2>

<P>The routine <CODE>PGHIST</CODE> draws a histogram, that is, the frequency distribution 
of measured values in a dataset.  Suppose we have 500 measurements of
a quantity (the sky brightness temperature at 20 GHz, say, in mK) stored
in Fortran array <CODE>VALUES</CODE>.  The following program-fragment draws a
histogram of the distribution of these values in the range 0.0 to 5.0,
using 25 bins (so that each bin is 0.2 K wide, the first running from 
0.0 to 0.2, the second from 0.2 to 0.4, etc.):
<PRE>
      DO 10 I=1,500
          VALUES(I) = ....
   10 CONTINUE
      CALL PGHIST(500, VALUES, 0.00, 5.00, 25, 0)
      CALL PGLAB('Temperature (K)',
     1           'Number of measurements',
     2           'Sky Brightness at 20 GHz' )
</PRE>
The histogram does not depend on the <I>order</I> of the values within 
the array.
