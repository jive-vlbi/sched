<H1>Interactive Graphics</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>The previous chapters have described how to produce a <I>static</I>
graphical image: if the same program is run twice with the same input
parameters, the same image will result.  An <I>interactive</I> program
allows the user to control the behavior of the program with a
graphical input device.  PGPLOT supports a limited interactive
capability on devices with a cursor for graphical input (e.g., Xwindow
workstations, some Tektronix terminals and emulators). The
capabilities are necessarily limited by the aim to keep PGPLOT
device-independent.</p>

<H2>The Cursor</H2>

<p>Some of the graphics devices supported by PGPLOT have a <I>graphics
cursor</I>.  This appears on the view surface as a plus sign, a
cross-hair, or a diamond, and can be moved around the view surface
with a mouse, joy-stick, or trackball attached to the graphics
device. If the hardware does not provide this mechanism, PGPLOT allows
the user to move the cursor using the arrow keys on his terminal. See
the <i>PGPLOT Device Manual</i> for instructions for using the cursor
on a specific device.</p>

<H2>Using the Cursor</H2>

<p>The basic routines for cursor input are PGCURS and PGBAND. Routine <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGCURS">PGCURS</A> enables the
cursor on the selected device, positions it at a specified location
within the viewport, and allows the user to move it.  When the user
has positioned the cursor, he types a key on his terminal;
PGCURS returns the cursor position (in world coordinates)
and the character that was typed. On some devices the user can also
click (depress and release) a mouse button. Buttons 1, 2, 3 have the
same effect as typing A, D, or X. Routine <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGBAND">PGBAND</A> is similar to
PGCURS but has additional options that request that a
visible line (``rubber band'') or rectangle join the cursor position
to a fixed point and track it as it moves. These options are not
available on every device that supports a cursor.</p>

<p>In addition, PGPLOT provides three higher-level routines for cursor
input: PGOLIN, PGNCUR, and
PGLCUR.  These three routines require that the device has
erase capability.</P>

<p><A HREF="subroutines.html#PGOLIN">PGOLIN</A> allows the user to
specify a set of points within the viewport, with the capability of
correcting mistakes. Interactive commands (single characters [A, D, or
X] typed on the keyboard) allow the user to <I>add</I> a point at the
current cursor position, <I>delete</I> the last-entered point, or
<I>exit</I> from the subroutine. The world-coordinates of the entered
points are returned to the calling program. The following program
fragments illustrate the use of PGOLIN; the user supplies <i>NPT</i> (up to
50) points with world-coordinates <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>, and the program then
shades the polygon defined by these points by calling PGPOLY:</p>

<PRE class="f">    INTEGER NPT
    REAL X(50), Y(50)
    ...
    WRITE (6,*) 'Use the cursor to draw a polygon'
    WRITE (6,*) 'Type A to add point, D to delete, X to exit'
    NPT = 0
    CALL PGOLIN (50, NPT, X, Y, 0)
    IF (NPT.GE.3) CALL PGPOLY (NPT, X, Y)
</PRE>

<PRE class="c">    int npt;
    float x(50), y(50);
    ...
    puts("Use the cursor to draw a polygon\n"
         "Type A to add point, D to delete, X to exit\n");
    npt = 0;
    cpgolin(50, &amp;npt, x, y, 0)
    if (npt &gt;= 3)
      cpgpoly(npt, x, y);
</PRE>

<p><A HREF="subroutines.html#PGNCUR">PGNCUR</A> is similar to
PGOLIN, but the points are sorted into increasing order
of <I>x</I> before being returned to the calling program. In addition,
the <I>delete</I> command deletes the point nearest to the cursor,
rather than the last-entered point. It can be used, for example, to
allow the user to supply a set of points to represent the continuum
level on a spectrum.</P>

<p><A HREF="subroutines.html#PGLCUR">PGLCUR</A> is similar to
PGOLIN but instead of using a graph marker to mark each
entered point it draws a polyline through them.</p>

<H2>Buffering</H2>

<p>By default, PGPLOT ensures that the image seen on the view surface is
up to date at all times; that is, each PGPLOT subroutine updates the
image before returning control to the calling program. To improve
efficiency, PGPLOT can save instructions for controlling the graphics
device in a buffer, and only send them to the device when the buffer
is filled up.  This means that at any given moment, the image
displayed on the screen may not be completely up to date. This can be
a problem in an interactive program, where, for example, the user has
to tell the program what to do next based on his interpretation of the
current display. Three PGPLOT routines (PGBBUF,
PGEBUF, and PGUPDT) are provided for
controlling the buffering of output. All three routines have no
arguments.</P>

<p>The routine <A HREF="subroutines.html#PGBBUF">PGBBUF</A>
causes PGPLOT to begin saving graphical output in a buffer. The output
is saved until (1) a matching PGEBUF call is made, or (2)
the buffer fills up, or (3) the buffer is emptied by a call to
PGUPDT, or (4) PGEND is called.  The routine
<A HREF="subroutines.html#PGEBUF">PGEBUF</A> stops
buffering and causes the buffered commands to be sent to the output
device. Calls to PGBBUF and PGEBUF should
always be paired. PGBBUF increments an internal counter,
while PGEBUF decrements this counter and flushes the
buffer to the output device when the counter drops to zero.  This
allows a subroutine to turn on and turn off buffering without
disturbing any buffering that may have been established by the calling
program.</P>

<p>Routine <A HREF="subroutines.html#PGUPDT">PGUPDT</A>
empties the buffer created by PGBBUF, but it does not
alter the internal counter. The routine should be called when it is
essential that the display be completely up-to-date (before
interaction with the user, for example) but it is not known if output
is being buffered.</P>

<p>Usually output is not buffered; this is the default state established
by PGOPEN (or PGBEG). The default behavior can be changed, however,
by defining an <A HREF="compiling.html#ENV">environment variable</A>
PGPLOT_BUFFER. If this variable is defined, with any
value, PGOPEN will start buffering output (by calling
PGBBUF).</P>

<p>The following examples show how routine PGLAB might be implemented
in terms of routine PGMTXT:</p>

<PRE class="f">    SUBROUTINE PGLAB (XLBL, YLBL, TOPLBL)
    CHARACTER*(*) XLBL, YLBL, TOPLBL
    CALL PGBBUF
    CALL PGMTXT('T', 2.0, 0.5, 0.5, TOPLBL)
    CALL PGMTXT('B', 3.2, 0.5, 0.5, XLBL)
    CALL PGMTXT('L', 2.2, 0.5, 0.5, YLBL)
    CALL PGEBUF
    END
</PRE>

<PRE class="c">  void cpglab(char *xlbl, char *ylbl, char *toplbl)
  {
    cpgbbuf();
    cpgmtxt("T", 2.0, 0.5, 0.5, toplbl);
    cpgmtxt("B", 3.2, 0.5, 0.5, xlbl);
    cpgmtxt("L", 2.2, 0.5, 0.5, ylbl);
    cpgebuf();
  }
</PRE>

<p>The calls to PGBBUF and PGEBUF ensure that the output generated by the
three calls to PGMTXT is buffered (i.e., sent to the output device as
a single command instead of three separate ones). If buffering is
already enabled by the program which calls PGLAB, the calls to PGBBUF
and PGEBUF have no effect.</P>

<p>On some devices (e.g., X-Window workstations) use of buffering can
greatly speed up the execution of a program.</P>

<H2>Animation</H2>

<p>An <i>animated</i> display is one that changes with time, or in
response to external events. Obviously, this is only possible on an
interactive device. In order to create a smooth animation, without
screen blanks between updates, it is necessary to do the following:</p>
<OL>
<LI>Do not call PGPAGE (or PGENV, which calls PGPAGE) between frames.
<LI>Enclose all the calls required to generate each frame between
    PGBBUF and PGEBUF calls, so that the updates are sent to the device as 
    a single unit.
<LI>Either: erase the entire previous frame by calling PGERAS before
    drawing the next frame; or: erase the parts of the frame that
    have changed by overwriting with the background color (color
    index 0).
</OL>

<p>It is usually easier to erase the entire frame and redraw it, and on a
fast device this will give satisfactory results. Erasing selected
parts of the display can be faster, but it may be difficult to avoid
erasing parts that should remain visible (e.g., if the text to be erased
lies on top of an image).</p>

<p>In outline, an animated program will look like the following:</p>

<PRE class="f">    IF (PGOPEN('/xserv') .LT. 1) STOP
    CALL PGPAGE
    ... 
    DO I=1,NFRAMES
        ... wait for event ...
        CALL PGBBUF
        CALL PGERAS
        ... draw new frame ...
	CALL PGEBUF
    END DO
    CALL PGCLOS
</PRE>
<PRE class="c">    if (cpgopen("/xserv") &lt; 1)
      return;
    cpgpage();
    ... 
    for (i=0; i &lt; NFRAMES; i++) {
      ... wait for event ...
      cpgbbuf();
      cpgeras();
      ... draw new frame ...
      cpgebuf();
    }
    cpgclos();
</PRE>
