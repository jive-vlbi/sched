<DT>Supported device
<DD>IBM PCs and compatibles
running Microsoft Fortran 5.0. This driver will put the display into
graphics mode.  To avoid `erasing' the screen when the program exits,
the display will be left in graphics mode.  Therefore, you will need
some other program to restore to the display to a (faster) text mode.

<DT>Device type code
<DD><CODE>/MSOFT</CODE>.

<DT>Default device name
<DD>none (the device name, if specified, is
ignored).

<DT>Default view surface dimensions
<DD>depends on monitor, 
typical 7 x 10 inches.

<DT>Resolution
<DD>Depends on graphics card.  Tested with a
640 x 300 EGA card.
Driver should work with other graphics cards, however, expect to
tweak it a bit.

<DT>Color capability
<DD>Color indices 0--15 are accepted.  This version maps
the PGPLOT color indices into the IBM color indices with the
default color most closely corresponds to the PGPLOT default color.
Thus, PGPLOT index 2 (red) maps to IBM index 12 (light red).

<DT>Input capability
<DD>?
