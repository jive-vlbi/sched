Installation Instructions: Mac OS X
</DIV>

<H1>Installation Instructions: Mac OS X</H1>

<p>PGPLOT can be installed on Apple Macintosh computers running Mac OS
X.  It uses the X-window system for display, as on other UNIX systems.
An alternative display, which does not use the X-window system, is
AquaTerm (see below). The following instructions are for MacOS 10.3
(Panther).</p>

<ol>

<li>Install the Apple Developer tools (Xcode) if you haven't already done so,
including the X11 SDK (Software Developer's Kit). The X11 SDK is an optional package on the Xcode disk.</li>

<li>Install Apple's X11 package. This is an optional package on the MacOS CD.</li>

<li>Install the g77 Fortran compiler. There are various ways to do
this. You can gte a working version of g77 from <a
href="http://hpc.sourceforge.net">http://hpc.sourceforge.net</a>. You
may also be able to use Fink (<a
href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/index.php">http://fink.sourceforge.net/index.php</a>).</li>

<li>Make sure you have working gcc and g77 commands in the terminal.</li>

<li>Download PGPLOT 5.3.0 from http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/.</li>

<li>Following the <a href="install-unix">Unix installation
instructions</a>, run makemake with options <code>darwin
g77_gcc</code>. Select the X11 drivers; you probably also want
PostScript and GIF.</li>

<li>You should be able to run the demo programs from an Xterm window.
There are some minor annoyances: the Apple X11 does not provide a
<code>pseudocolor visual</code>, so color-table animation (as used in
pgdemo4) does not work.  Getting the right window on top and accepting
keyboard input can be a pain.</li>

</ol>

<h2>AquaTerm</h2>

<p>Aquaterm (<a
href="http://aquaterm.sourceforge.net">http://aquaterm.sourceforge.net</a>)
is a graphics display terminal for Mac OS X.  You run the AquaTerm
application, and then direct PGPLOT output to it by using a device
specification &ldquo;/AQT&rdquo;. The display can be saved as a PDF
file or printed. AquaTerm comes with a PGPLOT device driver and
instructions for adding the driver to your version of PGPLOT.</p>

<h2>Hardcopy</h2>

<p>For the best-quality printable output, select PostScript
(&ldquo;/CPS&rdquo; [landscape] or &ldquo;/VCPS&rdquo; [portrait]).
You can view PostScript files on screen using Apple's Preview, or
under X11 usibg <code>gv</code> (available from Fink), and you can
send them directly to a PostScript printer using the lp command.  You
can also convert PostScript to PDF using either Acrobat Distiller or
the <code>ps2pdf</code> command (which is usually available when gv is
installed). PDF files are well supported by Mac OS X and can be viewed
with, e.g., Preview, Adobe Acrobat Reader, and many graphics
programs.</p>
