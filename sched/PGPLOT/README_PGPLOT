These are simplified instructions for installing the PGPLOT
distributed with SCHED from the code.  Compiled libraries are also
provided with SCHED, but there could be compatibility issues.  If you
want a full set of PGPLOT installation instructions, go to
src5.3.1/doc/index.html with a browser.

I have constructed a basic drivers.list for each architecture and have
made some small modifications to a couple of .conf files for use with
gfortran rather than g77.  Those are in the RCW_additions
subdirectories and are included in the src files with symbolic links.
Note that MAC OSX goes under "darwin".

You will need X11, gfortran and other programming tools installed, but
you need those for SCHED anyway so I won't go through the instructions
to get those.

Here are the steps:

1.  cd to, or create a directory to hold your compiled libraries etc.
Some are already here and can be used, such as osx_intel_5.3.1

2.  Get a drivers.list, probably from one of the provided directories
of the sort in (1).  If you are using an existing directory, it is
probably there already.  Feel free to edit to add output options.

3.  Execute makemake script to make the makefile and copy in some
other required files.  If you are using an existing directory and
there is a makefile present, this may not be needed.  An example line
to run makemake when the source code is in ../src5.3.1 (this for OSX 
and gfortran) is:

../src5.3.1/makemake ../src5.3.1 darwin gfortran_gcc

4. Run make (just type "make").
Check that libpgplot.a, libcpgplot.a grfont.dat, rgb.txt, and
pgwin_server are present after make is done.  There will be lots of
object modules and a few demo programs.  The object modules can be
cleaned out with a "make clean"

5. Set the environment variable PGPLOT_DIR to the directory where
you are working.  Example:
csh or tcsh:  
setenv PGPLOT_DIR /Users/cwalker/code/sched_work/PGPLOT/osx_intel_5.3.1
bash etc:
export PGPLOT_DIR=/Users/cwalker/code/sched_work/PGPLOT/osx_intel_5.3.1

You may want to put the setenv/export command in your login script.

Alternatively put the 5 files listed above, or symbolic links to them,
in, for example, $SCHED/lib/OSX_INTEL and point PGPLOT_DIR there.  Or
even put the files or links in the system area of your choice and set
PGPLOT_DIR accordingly.  The latter might be better if you wish to use
PGPLOT for other software.

That should do it.  There is much more detail in the included PGPLOT
documention referenced above.
