I am installing pgplot from scratch to explore including it with SCHED.

I am basing this on a version 5.3.0 that I got from Tim Pearson years
ago when I was first installing on Macs.  Version 5.2.2 is the latest
on the pgplot web site.  Since then, there has been a shift from g77
to gfortran which is requiring some changes.  I got a
gfortran_gcc.conf to put in sys_darwin from a web site that was mainly
aimed at bsd.

For reference, at http://www.lorene.obspm.fr/pgplot_quick.txt
the author made the makefile, then edited it.  There the following
change was made:
     # Replace "FFLAGC=-u -Wall -fPIC -O" in line 26
     #   by    "FFLAGC=-ffixed-form -ffixed-line-length-none -u -Wall -fPIC -O"
Did not do that for now.

Ran makemake and make.

Will need PGPLOT_DIR to point to where the following file are put:

       libpgplot.a
       grfont.dat
       rgb.txt
       pgxwin_server

In the past, I had those in /usr/local/pgplot.  That file is not there
after my disaster with macports (failed on both pgplot and g95 - do they
test their stuff?).  Make that place a link to the current directory.

Actually the make file points to /opt/local for macports.


Copy the above files to $SCHED/lib/OSX_INTEL.
Make a new makefile pointing there and test it.  It's ok.

Make a new directory $SCHED/RELATED_CODE/PGPLOT

Copy the src5.3.0 directory there.
Make an osx_intel_5.3.0 directory.
Put drivers.list there
rerun makemake and make.
