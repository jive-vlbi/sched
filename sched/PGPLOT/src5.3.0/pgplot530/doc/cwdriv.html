device obeying Gould Plotter Language.

<DT>Color capability
<DD>Up to 10 pens. Default is pen 1 which is
picked up on initialization without a call to PGSCI. Calls to PGSCI are
interpreted as the pen number and colors therefore depend on how the
pens have been loaded into the stalls. If a call is made for a pen
higher than 10 the selected pen defaults to 1.

the data to a file which can then be copied to the plotter or on a
terminal.
