<DT>Supported device
<DD>Hewlett Packard LaserJet, LaserJet+, or LaserJet II.

<DT>Device type code
<DD><CODE>/LJnn</CODE> where nn is a number 01--09.

<DT>Color capability
<DD>Color indices 0 (erase, white) and 1 (black) are
supported. It is not possible to change color representation.

<DT>Input capability
<DD>None.

To choose one of the specific LaserJet drivers, you must execute a DCL
command of the following form before executing your program:
<PRE>
$ DEFINE PGPLOT_LJ_MODE LJnn
</PRE>
where <CODE>nn</CODE> is a number 01--09 NDEV inclusive.  You may also use one of the
equivalent names listed above.  These equivalent names are an attempt
to make the driver names make sense.  They are decoded as follows:
   1st character: P for protrait orientation or
                  L for landscape orientation.
   2nd character: H for high resolution (300 dpi) or
                  M for medium resolution (150 dpi) or
                  L for low resolution (100 dpi).
   3rd character: B for a straight bitmap dump or
                  O for an optimized bitmap dump.
   4th character: R for a rectangular view surface or
                  S for a square view surface.

A few notes are in order.  First, not all of the possible combinations
above are supported (currently).  The driver that goes by the name of
PHOT is a driver that puts out bitmaps suitable for inclusion in TeX
output if you are using the Arbortext DVIHP program.  The only drivers
that will work with unexpanded LaserJet are LJ08 and LJ09.  The other
seven drivers require a LaserJet Plus or LaserJet II.  Finally, do NOT
attempt to send grayscale plots to the drivers that use the optimized 
bitmap dumps.  Terrible things will happen.
