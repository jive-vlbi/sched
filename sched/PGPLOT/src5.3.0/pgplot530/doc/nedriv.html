<DT>Supported device
<DD>Any computer running NeXTstep.
<DT>Device type code
<DD><CODE>/next</CODE>.
<DT>Default device name
<DD>none
<DT>Default view surface dimensions
<DD>The default screen size is 720 by 535 pixels (about 8 by 6 inches
    on a 19 inch monitor).  The aspect ratio was selected to match
    the /PS device.  The window can be resized larger or smaller.
<DT>Resolution
<DD>The screen resolution is 92 dpi.  The driver generates PostScript
    commands with a resolution 10 times greater than the screen resolution.
   This allows the window to be resized and/or a hardcopy to be made with
   no loss of resolution.
<DT>Color capability
<DD>On all devices, color indices 0-15 are supported.  The default colors
    are 0 is white, 1 is black, 14 is light gray, 15 dark gray.  On 
    monochrome devices, color indices 2-13 default to black.  If the
    driver detects a color server, then color indices 0-255 are allowed
    and color indices 2-13 default to the standard PGPLOT colors.
<DT>Input capability
<DD>The PGPLOT cursor is supported.  When a cursor read is requested the
    the viewer becomes the active application and the active plot window 
    becomes the key window.  This allows the user to terminate the cursor
    read by either a mouse click (which generates an 'A' character) or
    by pressing a key on the keyboard.
<DT>File format
<DD>By using the print command, in the main menu, you can send the
    contents of the current window to a file.  This file can then be
    printed on any PostScript printer.
<DT>Obtaining hardcopy
<DD>If you click on the print item in the main menu, then the standard
    NeXT print panel comes up.  This allows the contents of the current
    window to be sent to a printer, disk file or previewer.
