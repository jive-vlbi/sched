Version 9.2 of SCHED was released on March 10, 2010. It has been in
use at NRAO since then.  It can be downloaded from anonymous ftp at
ftp.aoc.nrao.edu from directory pub/sched.  The files are:

sched_9.2.tar.gz             Tar file with code, examples, 
                             catalogs, setups, and documentation.
binaries/LINUX/sched         Binary for 32bit Linux machine.
binaries/LINUX64/sched       Binary for 64bit Linux machine without
                             satellite tracking capability
binaries/LINUX64SPICE/sched  Binary for 64 bit Linux machine with 
                             satellite tracking capability
binaries/OSX_INTEL/sched     Binary for Mac OSX on an Intel chip.
binaries/OSXPPC/sched        Binary for Mac OSX on a PPC chip (older).
binaries/SUN/sched           Binary for Solaris

Each of the binaries directories also contains schclean which is a
script for deleting all SCHED output - sometimes useful for cleaning
up directories.
      
The manual can be read on the net (the recommended way) at

The changes are listed in the Current Release section of the manual.

Version 9.0 was not widely announced so upgrades in it will also be
new to some.  Note that Version 9.2 has been in partial use, as 9.1,
for several months.

Some highlights of the changes are:

There have been a number of changes to facilitate use of the DiFX
software correlator on the VLBA.  This includes production of VEX
files for all observations by default since VEX files are now used for
setting up correlation on DiFX and many other correlators.  The VLBA
and VLA will eventually move to the use of VEX for antenna control
of VLBI observations, so this transition has just begun.  Vex files
now have the extension ".vex" rather than ".skd"

Now when specifying the SOCORRO or VLBA correlator, SCHED assumes
DiFX.  This affects the checking of a number of parameters.  For those
who haven't heard, DiFX is now the standard correlator on the VLBA and
the old hardware correlator has been shut off.  It may yet get used
for some final tests, but not for astronomy projects.

Warnings are issued when excessively long recording scans are
encountered and when there might be an excessive number of recording
scans.  These are Mark5 issues that hopefully won't be with us
too much longer.

SCHED can now handle DOS end of line sequences.  This has been an
on-going cause of obscure errors after transfering key files by
email.  Some email tools insist on changing the format.

There have been improvements in the satellite tracking area.

The source and station catalogs have been updated based on the
GSFC 2009a and Petrov 2009c catalogs.  The old 2008a catalogs
are also available.

Different antennas can now have different "speed up factors".  
Eventually that concept will go away as it doesn't make much sense
with the newer correlators.

Note that the default for PRESTART was reverted from the 1.0sec
mentioned in the release notes to zero seconds after the manual was
finalized.

For the VLA, mixing VLA1 and VLA27 is allowed.

For the slew calculations, different acceleration and decelaration 
rates are handled.

For satellites, adjust the printed geometry information for the rates.
The assumption of slow motions was violated in some recent
observations.

There were many changes of a detailed nature. See the notes in the
manual.  Most will not be mentioned here.
