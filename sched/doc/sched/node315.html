Release of 18 Nov. 1997.
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Fix bug in setting of formats that occurs when VLBA/MarkIV
      modes are mixed with Mark III modes in a schedule.  This caused
      a core dump.  21Aug1997 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add Mitaka and Pentiction to the valid correlator list.
      8sep97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Clarify that correlator shipping address is for output.
      8sep97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Avoid postpass even on last tape of experiment for 1 tape
      stations.  Requested by Dave Graham but make sense to be
      the default.  While at it, changed VLBA stations (2 tape
      stations) to also avoid postpass when the last pass is
      continuous.  9sep97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add check that sun distance of a VLA phasing source is greater
      than the nominal limit before issuing a warning.  9sep97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Green Bank - Remove end of scan calibration.  Change default
      to Ts only, no Ta.  Use the MARKIII proceedure rather than VSST
      and VOBS for most cases.  9sep97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Implement multiple slew limits for XY antennas.  This is needed
      for Hobart.  10sep97  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix a bug in overlapping channel warning.  12sep97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make various changes to allow experiments with mixed setups.
      This is mainly to allow some stations to have dual polarization
      and others, that only have single channel receivers, to record
      only those channels with the single polarization.  The concept
      of ``logical'' channel for each setup file was introduced.
      If not all channels match a logical channels, <TT>DOPPLER,
      FREQ, and BW</TT> are not allowed.  Also, those parameters set
      the frequency and bandwidth for the logical channels which
      might not correspond 1-1 with the channels in an individual
      setup group.  Checks of compatibility between stations are
      done by logical channel.  12sep97.  RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add setup item PTOFF to allow independent setting of the
      half power distance and the off source position.  This
      is the result of problems notices with the 13cmsx gains that
      were the result of not going far enough off source.
      12sep97  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make tape autoallocation (AUTOTAPE) apply only to stations
      using VLBA control files.  13sep97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add a !NEXT! before the final !QUIT! for the final postpass
      scan.  This may be required to prevent the on-line system
      from ignoring the postpass.  17sep97  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change documentation and user messages in VLBACHG to reflect
      going to full rewind speed for postpasses. 15sep97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Update to latest VLA standard band frequencies.  21Oct97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix bug in roll group check for Wrobel mode in CHKSOC.  31Oct97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add SETGEO to pick BBCs for DAR=VLBAG stations (geodetic wiring
      of a VLBA rack.  For those racks, pay attention to the
      restrictions on which BBCs can see which IFs and the limits
      on how many BBCs can be used in 2 bit mode.  Modified BBC
      selection routine for MarkIV while at it (simplified).
      4 Nov 1997  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix bug in CHKVLBA that caused it to only check the first
      synthesizer frequency.  Unfortunately a couple of experiments
      were lost because of a user error that was not caught and should
      have been.  6 Nov 1997  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add VLAMODE='VB'.  6 Nov 1997.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix bug in accounting for logical channels.  10 Nov 1997.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make more obvious warning when a DAY forgotten at midnight.
      10 Nov 1997.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Remove many of the TAPEINI sections from the examples.  Leave
      a couple - they might still be needed for EVN only observations.
      10 Nov 1997

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Remove unused and dangerous DEFAULT option for station in
      setup files.  17 Nov 1997.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add CHKGDAR to check cable restrictions for ``geodetic'' VLBA
      stations.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Support x:y mounts like Hobard in VEX.  Nov 97, Huib.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Disabled use of modes that would excite the Mark IV BBC 9
      fan-out bug.  Nov 97, Huib

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Warn against 0 recorders in S2 modes that stopped Hart from
      observing.  Nov 97, Huib.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Introduce VLBAG DAR to VEX for stations with geodetic wiring.
      Nov 97, Huib.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There have been many catalog updates by RCW, Huib ...

<P>
