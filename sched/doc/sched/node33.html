NON-VLBA Telescopes with VLBA Recorders
</H2>

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; supports observations on telescopes that have VLBA
recorders but are controlled through PCFS. This is also done by
creating a <TT>*.skd</TT> file in the VEX format (see section on
<A HREF="node32.html#SSEC:MKIV"><TT>MkIV</TT></A>).

<P>
The telescopes are characterized by <TT>DAR = VLBA</TT> and <TT>RECORDER = VLBA</TT>, but <TT>CONTROL = VEX</TT>. They can have a flexible
number of BBCs, and usually have only 2 IF channels: A &amp; C.
The telescopes can only be requested to record in any of the
VLBA FORMATs.

<P>
In addition <TT>DAR = VLBA4</TT> and <TT>RECORDER = VLBA4</TT> systems have
been introduced. These use the flexible <TT>VLBA</TT> data acquisition
rack, but (<TT>DAR = VLBA4</TT>) have a Mark&nbsp;IV formatter mounted for
recording up to 1Gb/s. This also requires a <TT>RECORDER = VLBA4</TT> in
order to accomodate 2 recording heads (optional).  Note that these
systems write Mark&nbsp;IV formatted data and have been created to resemble
Mark&nbsp;IV systems. In this sense their name is misleading.  Several
features are not yet available or supported for VLBA recorders
controlled by PCFS, because of pending software developments.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Continuous tape motion is experimental. There is not always an
  automatic procedure for flagging data which is recorded during
  slewing.  In addition users need to insert gaps during continuous tape
  motion whenever they want calibration data.  At least 40 seconds are
  required to turn the tape around.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Phase Cal detection at the telescopes is not implemented. This
  would require a software upgrade in the field system and SCHED.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Most of the VLBA racks controlled by the field system have what is
known as the ``geodetic wiring''.  This means that not all of the
BBCs can see all IFs.  Also, there are not enough sampler inputs do
use 2 bit samples from more than the first 8 BBCs.  In fact, switching
between lots of BBCs at one bit and 8 BBCs at 2 bits requires moving
connectors that really weren't designed to be moved often.  This is
an invitation for trouble.  The IF restrictions are such that
BBCs 1-8 can see IFs A and C while BBCs 1, 2, and 9-14 can see B and D.
SCHED&nbsp; understands these restrictions in it's automatic BBC assignment
section.  Note that, in some cases, the stations will put the same
signals on IFs A and B and on C and D.  This can be dealt with in the
frequency catalog by giving B as the ALTIFN for A and D as the ALTIFN
for C (or visa versa).  Or, or course, you can specify IFCHAN explicitly
in the setup file.
