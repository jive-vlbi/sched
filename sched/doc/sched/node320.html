Release of 22 Feb 1996
</H2>

<P>
This is a slightly modified version of the SCHED&nbsp; that was
released within NRAO in December 1995.

<P>
This version included a number of evolutionary changes made up to
November 1995.  In that month, the VLBA OBSERVE (GNOMES) project
was cancelled and it became clear that SCHED&nbsp; had much more of a future
than expected.  Many changes, including addition of plotting and dwell time
scheduling, along with massive changes in internal structure for both
maintainability and for eventual Mark IV support, were made.  Also
the help file was renamed the manual, formated for LaTeX and html, and
to a large degree, rewritten.  It is now this document.

<P>
The evolutionary changes before November 1995 were:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Add <TT>REMARK</TT> to valid parameters in source catalog. Someday,
      print it in the summary file. (1995 May 31)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>First parallactic angle was PA2, not PA1, in PRTSCH. Fixed.
      (1995 June 4)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added horizons. (1995 June 17)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Warn if automatic tape allocation requested. (1995 June 26)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Rewrite optimization mode routines for easier modification.
      (1995 June)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Increase maximum number of setup files to 50. (1995 June 25)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make cover-like info in VLA observe file look like what
     VLA OBSERVE observe makes so observe will read it.
     (1995 July)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix rounding of F6 numbers for VLA, since did wrong thing when
      negative. (1995 October 3)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change reference pointing at VLA from <TT>IA</TT> to <TT>IR</TT>
      mode. Also, only put pointing request in VLBA control files if
      this is not a DAR-only station (1995 October 4)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Update some bits of VLA info in help file. A major review of the
      help file should be done soon. Also put the help file in HTML.
      (1995 October 4)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>SCHIN had <TT>FASTF</TT> instead of <TT>FASTFOR</TT> as per the
      documentation. Change to <TT>FASTFOR</TT>. (1995 October 30)
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The big rewrite included:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Added plotting.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added dwell time scheduling.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added new subroutines for setting up and reading KEYIN variables.
      It is now much easier to add and remove parameters.  Also,
      the number of inputs for arrays is now sensitive to the parameter
      statements.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Much restructuring of code.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Can now write telescope output files when optimization used.
      Optimization much better integrated into program.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Help file made into a manual and formated for LaTeX.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Manual made convertable to html by latex2html.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Reduced maximum stations and scans parameters.  Some variables
      with both dimensions were added so this keeps the size down.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Convert many time parameters to fractional days from radians
      inside program.  Not visible to user.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow in-line setup files much like the source and station
      catalogs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Setup files are now required for all projects.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow a ``default'' station in setup files (eg for Mark II or
      experiment planning).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Relative order of ``VLBA'' default station and any specific
      stations in a setup file no longer matters.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>SCHED no longer takes the number of channels from the main input
      file.  This is set only in the setup file.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The bandwidth is no longer required in the main file for
      observations using Doppler calculations -- it is obtained
      from the setup file.  It can still be changed in the main
      file.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The formats of the summary and sch files were changed somewhat.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>SUN proximity warnings no longer overwrite other comments.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>For dwell time scheduling, more general axis limits and slew
      rates were put in the station catalog.  Parameter HALIM was
      removed.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In the summary and sch files, scans below the horizon but
      above the slew limits are marked differently from scans below
      the slew limits

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Scan timing specification was enhanced.  GAP was added to
      take the place of the usual use of PRESCAN.  PRESCAN is now
      just a tape start offset.  It can be negative for prestarting
      tapes.  The changes are backward compatible

<P>
</LI>
<LI>SCHED&nbsp; internally calculates XYZ for stations if they are
      needed.  Mainly used in u-v plotting.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Put summary file output early enough in program that it is
      done and closed before plotting begins.  It can then be
      examined during plotting.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Now, when there is in-stream input such as tape initialization,
      source and station catalogs, line frequencies, or setup information,
      SCHED reads that input and then returns to reading input for
      the current scan.  No scan initialization is done.  Thus these
      in-stream inputs can go anywhere.  The main use of this will
      probably be to put the cover information at the top of the file.
      Another use is to put in-stream setup information in the main
      file at the scan where it is first used.  This is useful
      especially for test observations.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Let OPMINANT and OPMINEL apply regardless of optimization.  They
      are useful especially in planning.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The TPRATE parameter was removed.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow program restart from plotting input.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow setups with different numbers of tracks.  This can waste
      tape because the tape management will be done as if all scans
      used the maximum number of channels.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow specification of schedule input file name from main input.
      This allows one-time inputs, such as the request to plot, to be
      made before sending SCHED off to get the schedule input.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add DEBUG which turns on some extra printing.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VLABAND and VLABW were moved to the setup file.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added a toggle concept for many variables such as RECORD, TSYS,
      DOPPLER, etc.  Now they are paired with a NO... (eg NORECORD)
      that turns them off.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added OPSTYPE=VLA for pure VLA observations.  This helps tell
      SCHED not to worry about tape related stuff.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Changed DOPCAL to DOPPLER to avoid the confusion with DO PCAL.
      Added NODOP to turn it off.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Got latest SLALIB and updated a couple of places where there were
      changes.  Also got email permission to use it.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add OVERWRIT to allow sched to overwrite old files if desired.
      This is not the default as a safety measure.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Adding CSUB optimization mode.  The optimizes sky coverage.
      It includes subarrays.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Adding SUMITEM input to allow specification of what is in the
      summary file.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Changed <TT>XY</TT> mount type to <TT>XYNS</TT>.  Should add
      <TT>XYEW</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When the station catalog is read, the position both in geodetic
      longitude, latitude, and elevation and in geocentric X,Y,Z
      are determined from the information provided.  The catalog
      should contain one or both of the above coordinates.  The
      conversion is accurate at the cm level for coordinates in
      WGS84.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added Station XYZ to summary listing.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow vlba and vla defaults in <TT>TAPEINI</TT> section.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
