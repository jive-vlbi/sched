Station Catalog and Locations Catalog
</H1>

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; uses a catalog to get station information such as names,
positions, horizons, slew characteristics and more.  This catalog is
in keyin format.  Station positions may be stored separately in a
Locations Catalog.  There are standard Station and Location Catalogs
which will almost certainly have all stations used by a project.
SCHED&nbsp; will find these catalogs by default or their locations may be
specified.  Any or all of the Station Catalog entries may be given in
the main SCHED input if desired.  In any case, the scheduler
should consult the catalog to be sure that the right station names are
being used in the schedule.  The catalog associated with this release
of SCHED&nbsp; is at <A NAME="tex2html75"
  HREF="catalogs/stations.dat"><TT>$SCHED/catalogs/stations.dat</TT></A>.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; input parameter <TT>STAFILE</TT> is used to point to any desired
external catalog.  A file name of up to 80 characters can be
specified. The default is the standard catalog: 
<BR><TT>STAFILE=$SCHED/catalogs/stations.dat</TT>

<P>
Station catalog information can be given in the main SCHED&nbsp; keyin
file. If the keyword <TT>STACAT</TT> appears, all input after the next
``/'' is assumed to consist of station catalog entries until a line
containing the keyword <TT>ENDCAT</TT> and a ``/'' is encountered (don't
combine this keyword with a catalog entry).  Such ``in-line'' catalogs
must appear in the SCHED&nbsp; keyin file before the all of the input
for the first scan is complete.  This allows the use of station codes
to specify stations in each scan.

<P>
Both in-line catalog entries and an external catalog may be used for
the station catalog.  This would mainly be useful if there is a
non-standard antenna in the schedule.  That antenna's parameters can
be put in the in-line catalog while all other antennas are picked up
from the external catalog.  If you wish to prevent SCHED&nbsp; from
looking in external catalogs, specify <TT>STAFILE=NONE</TT>.

<P>
It is only necessary to give one of <TT>X</TT>, <TT>Y</TT>, and <TT>Z</TT> or
<TT>ELev</TT>, <TT>LAT</TT>, and <TT>LONG</TT>.  The missing set will be
calculated.  If both are given, the provided values will be used.  If
a conversion is done, the WGS84 ellipsoid is used and the calculations
are accurate at the cm level.  Since WGS84 is tied to the ITRF, this
should be a good way to convert GPS coordinates to the Earth centered
coordinates used in VLBI.

<P>
Some of the information that can be given in the station catalog can
also be provided through a locations catalog.  This is mostly position
information.  The locations catalog can be specified by <A HREF="node115.html#MP:LOCFILE"><TT>LOCFILE</TT></A>.  SCHED&nbsp; will read and store the locations
catalog before reading the stations catalog.  If the station position
is missing from the stations catalog, SCHED&nbsp; will search for a
station in the locations catalog with the name specified with <TT>DBNAME</TT> in the stations catalog.  If a match is found, the associated
coordinates will be used.  The locations catalog is used because, in
the standard catalogs, the station locations are from the VLBA
correlator data base while all the other information is from other
places.  It is much easier to maintain separate catalogs.  Users will
probably not need to worry about all this, except perhaps to specify
<A HREF="node115.html#MP:LOCFILE"><TT>LOCFILE</TT></A> if they keep the SCHED&nbsp; standard
catalogs in a non-standard place.

<P>
The parameters of the station catalog are given below.  Items that can
be in the locations catalog are noted.  Lower case letters are
optional.  Entries for a station in the Station Catalog are terminated with
a ``/''.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>STAtion</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station name. Up to 8 characters.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>STCode</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station code. Up to 3 characters.  Usually there
are 2 characters.  See Appendix <A HREF="node330.html#APP:STACODES">A.4</A> for a list
of codes.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DBNAME</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The station name used in the VLBA correlator
data base.  Might not be the same as <TT>STAtion</TT>.  <TT>DBNAME</TT> is
used to associate entries in the locations catalog with station
catalog entries.  SCHED&nbsp; uses <TT>STAtion</TT> for almost everything
else.  This name distinguishes each pad of the interferometers.
There is a matching parameter with the same name in the locations
catalog.  Up to 10 characters.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DBCODE</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The station code used in the VLBA correlator
data base.  May not be the same as <TT>STCode</TT>.  SCHED&nbsp; uses
<TT>STCode</TT> for almost everything.  This code distinguishes each
pad of the intererometers so contains more information than the
usual 2 letter codes given in <TT>STCode</TT>.  Can be put in the
locations catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>FRAME</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A character string indicating the origin
of the station location information.  Can be put in the locations
catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>CONtrol</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Telescope control file type. Valid options are
<TT>VLBA</TT> for VLBA control files,
<TT>VEX</TT> for Mark IV stations and any other stations with that
understand the VEX format,
<TT>SNAP</TT> for most stations (Mark II only -- does not handle
Mark&nbsp;III or Mark IV),
<TT>NRAO</TT> for 140-ft type control files,
<TT>VLA</TT> for VLA observe files,
<TT>VSOP</TT> for VSOP type DRUDG files (Japanese version only), and
<TT>NONE</TT> for no control file - the default.
A <TT>V</TT> in the 5th character will cause a VLBA
control file to be produced without non-DAS (Data Aquisition System
-- BBC's, formatter, tape recorder etc) to be produced.  If the first
4 characters were VLBA, this will be the only file.  If they were
something else, both the other type of file and the reduced VLBA file
will be produced.  This is the default when <TT>CONTROL = VLA</TT>.
Option <TT>SN50</TT> is also available for snap files with forced B1950
coordinates.  The <TT>VEX</TT> option for even one station triggers
production of a VEX format .skd file (once this software is ready) for
all stations in addition to any antenna specific files requested.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DAR</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Gives the type of Data Aquisition Rack present.
This is mainly to identify the type of formatter is at the station
which will let the program know about the capabilities available.
Valid types are: <TT>VLBA</TT>, <TT>MKIV</TT>, <TT>VLBA4</TT>, <TT>MKIII</TT>,
<TT>S2</TT>, <TT>K4</TT>, <TT>VSOP</TT> and <TT>NONE</TT> (the default).  Note
that for Mark II scheduling (basically obsolete), any site scheduled
will be assumed to have Mark II equipment.  The main non-obvious
option above is <TT>VLBA4</TT>, which is a VLBA DAR but with a Mark IV
formatter installed.  This will have VLBA BBC's and IF switching, but
Mark IV formatting characteristics.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>RECORDER</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Gives the type of tape recorder(s) present
Valid options are: <TT>VLBA</TT>, <TT>MKIV</TT>, <TT>VLBA4</TT>, <TT>MKIII</TT>,
<TT>S2</TT>, <TT>K4</TT>, <TT>VSOP</TT>, and <TT>NONE</TT> (the default).  The
<TT>VLBA4</TT> option is for VLBA recorders which have been modified
for 16 Mbps per track operation and can be equiped with 2 recording
heads.  They are usually associated with <TT>MKIV</TT> or <TT>VLBA4</TT> DARs.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>NBBC</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Tells SCHED&nbsp; how many BBC's or VC's are at the
site.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>NDRIVES</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Gives the number of tape drives at the sites.
Most have only 1 but all VLBA sites, for example, have 2.  This
can be overridden for a schedule using the NDRIVES parameter in
the tape initialization information.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>NHEADS</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Gives the number of recording head blocks on
each VLBA or MKIV drive.  This will be useful mainly for MKIV
(and VLBA4) which will at some point have 2.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DISK</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Used to indicate that a disk based recording system
is available at the station.  Which system to use depends on the value
of the <A HREF="node213.html#TP:MEDIA"><TT>MEDIA</TT></A> parameter in the
<A HREF="node211.html#SEC:TPINI">tape initialization information</A>.  For VLBA
systems, commands for both <TT>RECORDER</TT> and <TT>DISK</TT> can be
included in the control file.  Valid arguments to <TT>DISK</TT> for
now are restricted to <TT>MARK5A</TT> and <TT>NONE</TT> (the default).
<TT>MARK5B</TT> will be valid later.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>MEDIADEF</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Gives the default recording system to use.  It
can be overridden by <TT>MEDIA</TT> in the <A HREF="node192.html#MP:TAPEINI"><TT>TAPEINI</TT></A> section.  The options are <TT>TAPE</TT> and <TT>DISK</TT>.  This is meant to facilitate VLBA operations during the
transition from tape to disk.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>ELev</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station elevation in meters above (mean?) sea
level for geodetic coordinates or meters from the center of the Earth
for geocentric coordinates; these cases are distinguished by value
magnitude.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>LAT</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station latitude, either geodetic or geocentric.
The format is <TT>dd:mm:ss</TT>. Positive in Northern Hemisphere.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>LONG</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station longitude, either geodetic or geocentric.
The format is <TT>ddd:mm:ss</TT>. Positive in Western Hemisphere.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>ZALim</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Zenith angle limit in degrees.  Can be used to
limit elevation coverage for stations with other than AZEL mounts.
The antenna will be assumed to point below this limit to whatever
limits are specified with <TT>AX1LIM</TT> and <TT>AX2LIM</TT> for purposes
of slew calculations.  However, if the antenna is below this limit,
the source will be considered to be down during any optimizations.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>X</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station X coordinate in meters.  This is in the
direction of the Greenwich meridian.  Can be put in the locations
catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>Y</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station Y coordinate in meters.  This makes a right
handed coordinate system with X and Z.  Can be put in the locations
catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>Z</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station Z coordinate in meters.  This is in the
direction of the north pole.  Can be put in the locations catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DXDT</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station rate of change of the X coordinate in
meters per year.  Not used in SCHED.  Can be put in the locations
catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DYDT</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station rate of change of the Y coordinate
in meters per year.  Not used in SCHED.  Can be put in the locations
catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DZDT</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Station rate of change of the Z coordinate
in meters per year.  Not used in SCHED.  Can be put in the locations
catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>EPOCH</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The epoch in MJD at which the X, Y, Z
coordinates apply.  In other words, when the offsets due to the
rates is zero.  Not used by SCHED.  Can be put in the locations
catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DEScrip</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Any text up to 80 characters (not used
by SCHED).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>NDRIVES</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Number of wide band tape recorders at each site.
This should be the maximum number of drives at the station.  If less
are in service, the <A HREF="node211.html#SEC:TPINI">tape initialization</A> input,
<A HREF="node214.html#TP:NDRIVES"><TT>NDRIVES</TT></A> can be used to sepcify the
smaller number.  For S2 sites, NDRIVES should be the number of individual
recorders.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>HOR_AZ</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Up to 200 azimuths at which horizon elevations
are given in <TT>HOR_EL</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>HOR_EL</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Up to 200 elevations for the horizon at the
azimuths specified by <TT>HOR_AZ</TT>. SCHED's down, rise, and set
notes will take these horizons into account. They will also be used in
the optimization mode.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>MOUNT</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The type of mount.  SCHED&nbsp; uses this, along with
the axis limits and rates, to calculate slew times.  The understood
options are <TT>ALTAZ</TT>, <TT>EQUAT</TT>, <TT>XYEW</TT> and <TT>XYNS</TT>.  Note
that <TT>XYNS</TT> is for an XY axis system with the fixed axis in the
north-south direction (for example, Fairbanks).  <TT>XYEW</TT>
is for the other orientation (for example, Hobart).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>AXISTYPE</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The axis type as recorded in the VLBA
correlator data base.  Not used by SCHED.  There are different
keywords here than for <TT>MOUNT</TT>.  Some day this should be cleaned
up.  Can be put in the locations catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>AXISOFF</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The axis offset in meters.  Not used by SCHED.
Can be put in the locations catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>AX1LIM</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The slew limits for the first axis which is
usually azimuth, hour angle or X.  The units are degrees for azimuth
or X and hours for equatatorial mounts.  There are up to 3 pairs of
numbers giving the lower and upper limits for 3 different parts of the
sky.  This is required to describe the limits for the 140' at Green
Bank and for XY antennas such as Hobart.  Only the first set will be
used for altaz antennas.  For altaz antennas, the zero for azimuth is
to the north and positive is clockwise looking down on the antenna.
For XY antennas, positive is to the north or east.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>AX2LIM</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The slew limits for the second axis which is
usually elevation, declination, or Y.  The units are degrees in all
cases.  There are 3 pairs of numbers which define the three parts
of the sky over which the 3 pairs of <TT>AX1LIM</TT>s apply.  The ranges
for altaz antennas should not overlap, although they can touch.  For
XY antennas, overlaps are ok.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>AX1RATE</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The slew rate for the first axis in degrees
per minute for all mount types.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>AX2RATE</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The slew rate for the second axis in degrees
per minute.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>AX1ACC</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The acceleration for the first axis in degrees
per second squared for all mount types.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>AX2ACC</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The acceleration for the second axis in degrees
per second squared.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>TSETTLE</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The time in seconds (or mm:ss etc) to add to
the slew time for dwell time scheduling to determine when the antenna
is ready to observe.  This will include any computer overhead,
and time to make calibration observations.  Acceleration and
deceleration will be calculated explicitly if the above acceleration
parameters are provided in the station catalog.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>MINSETUP</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The minimum interval between scans when using
dwell time scheduling.  If the slew time plus the settling time
drops below <TT>MINSETUP</TT>, <TT>MINSETUP</TT> will be used as the
interval between scans.  This is required because some antennas have
a minimum scan setup time but the actions that take that time can
overlap with the slew.  When the slew is long, the extra time does
not need to be added.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>MAXSRCHR</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The maximum number of sources per hour.
This is originally intended to enable enforcement of the limit in
the number of slews per hour on the Mark1 telescope at Jodrell.  They
are very worried about fatigue and will refuse to run fast switching
schedules.  The default is 1.E6 which should be more than anyone
would try to schedule.
