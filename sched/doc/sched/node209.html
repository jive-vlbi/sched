Source Catalog
</H1>

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; uses a catalog to get source information such as names,
positions, and velocities.  This catalog is in keyin format. Entries
are terminated with a ``/''.  Some or all of the catalog may be
included in a section in the SCHED input file.  SCHED will look
there first for sources, and then go to an external catalog to find
the rest (or all).  There is a standard catalog, <I>sources.vlba</I>,
included with the SCHED&nbsp; distribution, which will probably have most,
if not all, sources in a project.  The scheduler may just refer to
this catalog, or may copy the desired entries into catalog sections in
the main SCHED&nbsp; input.  The scheduler should consult the catalog to
be sure that the right source names are being used in the schedule.

<P>
The a standard source catalog contains sources from a USNO geodetic
VLBI list (very similar to the International Celestial Reference Frame
or ICRF; these have <TT>CALCODE=N</TT>), from the VLA calibrator list
(<TT>CALCODE=Y</TT>), and from the JVAS survey (<TT>CALCODE=M</TT>;Patnaik
et al. 1992, mnras, 254, 655; Browne et al. 1998, mnras, 293, 257;
Wilkinson et al. 1998, mnras, 300, 790).  The USNO sources have
positions good to typically a milliarcsecond or better.  The JVAS
sources are good to 12-55 mas.  The VLA calibrator positions are
somewhat worse than the JVAS positions.  Eventually the JVAS positions
will be determined to an accuracy of about a mas.  There are several
thousand sources in the catalog.  This catalog is a direct reflection
of what was in the Socorro correlator source data base at the time of
its creation so the coordinates are likely to be those used by default
for correlation.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; input parameter <TT>SRCFILE</TT> is used to point to any desired
external catalog.  A file name of up to 80 characters can be
specified. The default source file is: 
<BR><TT>SRCFILE=$SCHED/catalogs/sources.vlba</TT>.  
<BR>
On unix systems with the
environment variable SCHED properly defined, this is the standard
catalog distributed with SCHED.  Users of the html version of the
manual can read the catalog by clicking
<A NAME="tex2html73"
  HREF="catalogs/sources.vlba">here.</A>.

<P>
Source catalog information can be given in the main SCHED&nbsp; keyin
file. If the keyword <TT>SRCCAT</TT> appears, all input after the next
``/'' is assumed to consist of source catalog entries until a line
containing the keyword <TT>ENDCAT</TT> and a ``/'' is encountered (don't
combine this keyword with a catalog entry).  Such ``in-line'' catalogs
may appear anywhere in a SCHED&nbsp; keyin file, although it is probably
best to put them near the beginning.  SCHED will look in the
external catalog for any source not found in an in-line catalog.  If
you wish to prevent SCHED&nbsp; from looking in external catalogs, specify
<TT>SRCFILE=NONE</TT>.  It is common to provide in-line source catalog
entries for unique program sources, but let SCHED&nbsp; find the fringe
finders and other calibrators in the standard catalog.

<P>
The parameters for each entry in the source catalog are below.  Lower
case letters in this list are optional.  All catalog parameters except
<TT>EQUINOX</TT> and <TT>EPOCH</TT> revert to a default unless specified
for a source. <TT>EQUINOX</TT> and <TT>EPOCH</TT> default to the last specified.

<P>
Note that the <A HREF="node11.html#SEC:PLOT">plotting capabilities</A> of SCHED,
specifically the RD plots, can be used to examine the distribution
of sources in the catalog and to find catalog near any desired
location.  This is useful, for example, for finding phase calibrators
near target sources.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; will use whichever equinox coordinates are provided in the
catalog and determine J2000, B1950, and DATE coordinates.  All of these
coordinates are listed in the <I>.sum</I> file.  Various stations require
different equinox coordinates.  For example, the VLBA only understands
J2000 coordinates while some other sites only understand B1950.  Sched
uses the SLALIB routines to make the coordinate conversions.

<P>
The J2000 and B1950 coordinates systems move relative to each other so
an ``observe'' date is needed to make an accurate conversion.  This is
the date at which the coordinates of the reference sources were
determined.  For example, the VLA calibrator list coordinates were
determined in 1979.9 originally, and all subsequent updates, based
mainly on J2000 positions, were precessed to B1950 using an assumed
``observe'' date of 1979.9.  A similar situation exists at MERLIN,
where observing is done in B1950 coordinates.  There, the calibrator
positions (based again on positions provided originally in J2000) are
precessed to B1950 using an ``observe'' date of 1950.0.  Any B1950
source position determined on MERLIN should be precessed to other
systems using that date.  The user can specify the ``observe'' date
using the main schedule parameter <A HREF="node159.html#MP:PRECDATE"><TT>PRECDATE</TT></A> which defaults to 1979.9, the correct value for use with
B1950 source positions determined on the VLA.  For purposes of
pointing antennas, the value of this date that is used is not very
important.  But if you are trying to phase reference, phase the VLA at
a high frequency, or derive positions for correlation, this is an
issue that should be dealt with properly.

<P>
The parameters of the source catalog are:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>Source</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the name of the source.  Up to 5
source names can be provided to handle aliases.  The names can have
up to 12 characters each, although, as noted below, some downstream
software may not like that much.  No software we know of requires less
than 8 characters.

<P>
Be a bit careful about special characters included in source names.
Some are benign.  But, for example, the * and ? characters are used as
wild cards in many programs so, if either ends up in a file name (as
it will after SPLIT in AIPS), it could cause problems.  The temptation
to use * is high because of sources such as SgrA*.  But the
conservative approach is to avoid it.  Also, do not include imbedded
blanks in source names, as they cause problems at a variety of places
in processing.

<P>
Note that the number of characters you can have may be limited by
downstream software.  Snap files require source names of 10 characters
or less, but are not normally written by SCHED&nbsp; any more.  VLA
observe files have a total of 13 characters for the source name plus
qualifier. If the qualifier is 0 (default), no characters are needed
for it. Otherwise, the qualifier needs however many digits it uses
(<EM>e.g.</EM>, 2 digits for qualifier ``33'') plus one for a blank to
separate it from the source name. If either the VLA or a snap file
needs shorter name, SCHED&nbsp; will use the first alias of 8 characters
or less, so be sure to include such an alias if it will be needed.
Finally, beware that the Mark&nbsp;III correlators and the geodetic
software have 8 character source name limits.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>Ra</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Right ascension. Remember that the VLA and
Westerbork need sub-arcsecond positions for phasing.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>RAERR</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The angular error in the RA direction in
milliarcseconds.  Note that for RA, this is not the coordinate error.
For that, one would need to divide RAERR by 15 to convert to time units
and divide by cos(dec) to account for the convergence of lines of RA
near the poles.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>Dec</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Declination.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DECERR</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The angular error in the declination direction in
milliarcseconds.  For dec, this is the same as the coordinate error.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>EQuinox</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Epoch of the observations. Allowed values are
<TT>B1950</TT>, <TT>J2000</TT>, and <TT>DATE</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>Calcode</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Single-character calcode used for VLA and VLBA
control files. It is used by postprocessing packages to identify types
of sources, usually types of calibrators.  The <TT>CALCODE</TT> is
optional for SCHED.  <TT>CALCODE='G'</TT> is reserved for pulsar
observations.  This calcode will trigger the use of the pulsar gate on
the VLBA correlator.  Think of <TT>G</TT> as ``Gate''.  <TT>CALCODE='L'</TT>
triggers on-line/off-line channel differences to be used for pointing
data analysis.  <TT>CALCODE='Z'</TT> indicates that the source is a
satellite and that ephemeris data are needed for correlation (SCHED&nbsp; 
will set this one for any satellite).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>VElocity</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Velocity (km/s) of a spectral line
source. Up to 8 (16?) values can be given, one per base band
channel. The value for the first base band channel will be used for
any other channels for which no velocity is specified.  The
reference frame (eg LSR, Heliocentric...) and definition
(radio, optical or redshift) are given by <TT>VREF</TT> and
<TT>VDEF</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>VRef</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The reference frame for velocity calculations.
Supported options so far are <TT>'L'</TT> for LSR, <TT>'H'</TT>
for heliocentric and <TT>'G'</TT> for geocentric.  LSR is the default.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>VDef</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The definition of the velocity.  Supported options
are <TT>'R'</TT> for radio definition (<!-- MATH
 $V=c ( \nu_0 - \nu) / \nu_0$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="68" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$ V=c ( \nu_0 - \nu) / \nu_0$">),
<TT>'O'</TT> for optical definition ( <!-- MATH
 $V= c ( \nu_0 - \nu ) / \nu = c (
\lambda - \lambda_0 ) / \lambda_0 = zc$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="311" HEIGHT="68" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$ V= c ( \nu_0 - \nu ) / \nu = c (
\lambda - \lambda_0 ) / \lambda_0 = zc $"> ), and <TT>'Z'</TT> if the
redshift is given directly.  The default is the radio definition.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>PMEPOCH</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>For planetary motion, the offset
from the <TT>RA</TT> and <TT>DEC</TT> are assumed to be zero at this time.
The format is <TT>PMEPOCH = yyyy,mm,dd,hh:mm:ss</TT>; for example, <TT>PMEPOCH = 1995,12,7,15:0:0</TT> for 15 hours UT on 1995 December 7.
I appologize for any confusion caused by <TT>PMEPOCH</TT> not being the
zero time for <TT>PMRA</TT> and <TT>PMDEC</TT> instead of <TT>DRA</TT> and
<TT>DDEC</TT>.  The SCHEDusage for planetary motion was established
long before the proper motions were added to the program and I did
not want to change the meaning of <TT>PMEPOCH</TT>.  Also <TT>EPOCH</TT>
is the standard throughout astronomy for the zero time of proper motion,
which is why it's meaning was changed from what is now <TT>EQUINOX</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DRA</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Rate of change of <TT>RA</TT> in seconds of time per
UT day.  This acts in coordinates of date.  Note that this is the
rate of change of the coordinate value, not the angular rate which
would be larger by 1/cos(dec).  The zero offset time is given by
<TT>PMEPOCH</TT>.  Use <TT>DRA</TT> and <TT>DDEC</TT> for fast moving objects
like planets.  Use <TT>PMRA</TT> and <TT>PMDEC</TT> for slow moving
objects like stars.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>DDEC</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Rate of change of <TT>DEC</TT> in arcseconds per UT
day. Note that the azimuth and elevation reported by SCHED&nbsp; will not
take into account <TT>DRA</TT> and <TT>DDEC</TT>. This acts in coordinates
of date.  The zero offset time is given by <TT>PMEPOCH</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>PMRA</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The proper motion in RA in milli arcseconds per year.
This is an angular value and is 1/cos(dec) times the change in
coordinate value.  The zero offset time is given by <TT>EPOCH</TT>.  When
<TT>PMRA</TT>, <TT>PMDEC</TT>, or <TT>PARALAX</TT> is used, the source
coordinates are shifted from the time specified by <TT>EPOCH</TT> to a
time that is the stop time of the first scan or, if it is given, <TT>PMEPOCH</TT>.  <TT>PMRA</TT>, <TT>PMDEC</TT> are added to <TT>DRA</TT> and <TT>DDEC</TT> respectively so that small motions during the observation of
fast moving stars can be accomodated.  The proper motion and planetary
motion parameters can both be used together, if one is mad enough
to want to do so.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>PMDEC</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The proper motion in Dec in milli arcseconds per year.
The zero offset time is given by <TT>EPOCH</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>EPoch</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The zero point for proper motion expressed as
a fractional year such as 1993.6.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>PARALAX</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The paralax in milli arcseconds.
