Spectral Line Observations
</H1>

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; can set observing frequencies for spectral line observations
based on velocities provided in the source catalog and rest
frequencies provided in a separate type of input. This option is
invoked by specifying <A HREF="node78.html#MP:DOPPLER"><TT>DOPPLER</TT></A> and can be
turned off with <A HREF="node78.html#MP:DOPPLER"><TT>NODOP</TT></A> (<TT>DOPCAL</TT> is an
obsolete form that was too easy to confuse with ``DO PCAL'').  If <TT>DOPPLER</TT> is invoked, SCHED&nbsp; calculates the velocity of the center of
the Earth with respect to the designated reference frame (<TT>VREF</TT>
in the direction of the source at the time of the middle of the
project. From this velocity, the source velocity from the source
catalog, and the rest frequency, the required observing center
frequency is calculated.  The antennas need to know the LO settings so
SCHED&nbsp; must know the bandwidth.  The bandwidth will usually be
obtained from the setup file.  It may be provided for the scan with
the <A HREF="node57.html#MP:BW"><TT>BW</TT></A> parameter.

<P>
The reference frames supported by SCHED&nbsp; are the ``Local Standard
of Rest'' or LSR <TT>VREF=L</TT>, heliocentric <TT>VREF=H</TT>, and
geocentric <TT>VREF=G</TT>.

<P>
Note that channels assigned to the same BBC will be given the same
frequency as the first channel on that BBC, no matter what velocities
etc are given for the other channels.  This will be the case when
there are upper/lower sideband pairs.  Their frequencies cannot
be set independently.  Because of the different sidebands, they
will, however, cover different velocity ranges.

<P>
The frequencies derived from the doppler calculations have to be
rounded off to a value that can be set on the available synthesizers.
For the Mark&nbsp;III/IV and VLBA systems, frequencies can be set to
the nearest 10 kHz.  However other systems are different -- VSOP, for
example, can only be set to the nearest 1 MHz.  The parameter
<A HREF="node77.html#MP:DOPINCR"><TT>DOPINCR</TT></A> can be used to control the rounding.

<P>
The doppler calculations are for the center of the Earth for the
middle of the project. This implies that the frequency for each source
will be constant for the duration of the project. Experience over the
years with spectral line VLBI has shown this to be the preferred
observing mode since it minimizes the chances of mistakes at stations
that do not have automatic frequency setting. The shifts of the
resulting spectra of about a km per second that result from the
rotation of the Earth can be removed in post-processing with the CVEL program in the NRAO spectral line software or with a task of the
same name and with similar capability in AIPS.

<P>
The LO sum used when doppler calculations are requested are calculated
by either the radio definition (<TT>VDEF=R</TT> in the source catalog )
or the optical definition (<TT>VDEF=O</TT> or <TT>VDEF=Z</TT>). With the
radio definition, the LO sum is calculated as RESTFREQ * (1 - v/c) -
BW/2 where RESTFREQ is the line rest frequency from the line
initialization input, c is the speed of light, and BW is the bandwidth
(appropriately signed according to the sideband).  With the optical
definition, the LO sum is RESTFREQ / (1 + v/c) - BW/2.  Typically
velocities for radio spectral lines in galactic sources are given in
the radio definition in the LSR frame.  Extragalactic velocities, on
the other hand, are typically in the optical definition in the
heliocentric frame.  The differences in the radio and optical
definitions only matter at large (typically extragalactic) velocities.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; will accept redshifts if <TT>VDEF=Z</TT> in place of
velocities, but be very careful that you have adequate accuracy
to calculate proper frequencies - the bandwidths are typically
very much smaller than the observing frequency so the velocities
must be accurate.

<P>
Internally, if Doppler calculation is requested, SCHED&nbsp; calculates
the desired observing frequencies and puts them in the same array that
would be used if <A HREF="node94.html#MP:FREQ"><TT>FREQ</TT></A> were used. This will
override any <TT>FREQ</TT> specifications in the main schedule and any
frequency specifications in the setup files.  The frequencies of
baseband converters will then be set properly based on the
<A HREF="node230.html#SP:FIRSTLO"><TT>FIRSTLO</TT></A> for the station.  Please note that
the setup files must still contain a complete, valid frequency
specification.  This is to allow validity checking and to allow
SCHED&nbsp; to pick up default parameters from the
<A HREF="node211.html#SEC:FRQCAT">frequency catalog</A>.  The frequency in the setup
should be close enough to the desired observing frequency that only
final tuning of the BBCs is needed to get the exact desired frequency.
For the VLBA with its 500 MHz IFs, this is not a serious concern.  It
might be for the VLA (50 MHz IFs) or other antennas with narrow IFs.

<P>
The number of channels desired is set with <A HREF="node244.html#SP:NCHAN"><TT>NCHAN</TT></A> in the setup file (<TT>NCHAN</TT> in the main schedule
is an obsolete parameter and is not used.).  To calculate a frequency,
SCHED&nbsp; must have, for each channel, a bandwidth, a velocity from
the source catalog, and a rest frequency from the line initialization
input information.  If a value is missing for any channel of any
parameter, the value of that parameter for channel 1 will be
used. This avoids the need, for example, of specifying lots of
bandwidths when they are all the same.

<P>
For continuum sources mixed in with line sources, specify <A HREF="node78.html#MP:DOPPLER"><TT>NODOP</TT></A> for that scan to avoid the Doppler calculations.

<P>
Often it is desired to observe a continuum source at the same
frequency as a line source for bandpass calibration. This can be done
by specifying the line source with <A HREF="node79.html#MP:DOPSRC"><TT>DOPSRC</TT></A>
in the continuum source's scan. The <TT>DOPSRC</TT> will be used for the
Doppler calculation.

<P>
The important parameters in the SCHED&nbsp; keyin file for Doppler
frequency calculation are listed below. Detailed descriptions are
given with the descriptions of other SCHED&nbsp; parameters.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="node78.html#MP:DOPPLER"><TT>DOPPLER</TT> and <TT>NODOP</TT></A> turn the
Doppler calculations on and off.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="node79.html#MP:DOPSRC"><TT>DOPSRC</TT></A> is used to specify the source,
if it is different from the scan source, for which the Doppler calculations
should be made.  This is useful for bandpass calibration.  Warning -
as with nearly all SCHED variables, it defaults to the previous scan.
After using it, be sure to set it to blank or to the next source.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="node77.html#MP:DOPINCR"><TT>DOPINCR</TT></A> is used to determine the level
of rounding of frequencies that is used.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="node112.html#MP:LINENAME"><TT>LINENAME</TT></A> specifies which group of
rest frequencies to use. It must match one of the sets of lines
named with <TT>LINESET</TT> in the <TT>LINEINIT</TT> input.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="node57.html#MP:BW"><TT>BW</TT></A> sets the bandwidth for the scan and
overrides the setup file value.  This is useful for switching between
wideband observations on calibrators and narrow band observations on
line sources.  The value in the setup file will be used if it is
not specified.  This parameter is not allowed if VEX files are being
written.  In general, it is a good idea to use a new setup file when
changing bandwidths because quite a few other parameters also change.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="node111.html#MP:LINEINIT"><TT>LINEINIT</TT></A> indicates that after the
next ``/'', information on the rest frequencies of spectral lines will
be given.  If invoked, the rest frequencies will be read, and SCHED&nbsp; 
will return to reading input for the same scan that it was on before
the ``/''.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The rest frequencies are specified in separate keyin inputs in the
SCHED&nbsp; keyin file following a ``/'' if <TT>LINEINIT</TT> was specified.
There can be one rest frequency per channel, although any not
specified default to the first which is often the desired
behavior. There should be one velocity per channel in the source file
for each source to be observed (other than continuum
calibrators). Each group of lines has a name which is then refered to
using <A HREF="node112.html#MP:LINENAME"><TT>LINENAME</TT></A> in the scan input. The
group can change with each scan, but be careful to change the setup
file, too, if necessary.  Up to 10 groups of lines are allowed. The
parameters in the <TT>LINEINIT</TT> group are:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>LINESET</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Name of the group of lines. <TT>LINENAME</TT> in

<P>
The example below shows the SCHED&nbsp; input for a spectral line
It is a modified version of the file used for a project by Phil Diamond
in Dec 95.  The modifications are to adjust for some of the new features
of SCHED&nbsp; that were not available at the time the file was used.
Note that the tape initialization stuff probably could be defaulted
and that it is not necessary to repeat the DUR and GAP specification
every scan.  However some users prefer to show these details and
it certainly doesn't hurt.  Also, the bandwidth specification is the
same as the setup file so it is not required (it used to be).
