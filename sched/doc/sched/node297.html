Version 6.02 (Released 29 July 2005)
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Some VLBA control file parameters are not used when
recording to non-tape media such as Mark5.  The parameters <TT>autoallocate, autoreverse, barrel,</TT> and <TT>track</TT> will no longer
be written in such circumstances.  1 Apr 2005  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Remove option to record on tape at VLBA_LA and VLBA_KP.  The
drives have been removed from the stations as part of the conversion to
Mark5.  This revealed some of the problems noted below.  April 2005  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>SCHED&nbsp; was claiming, in the summary file, that some setup files
were identical when they were not.  The problem was a typo in the
channel index when comparing channel dependent data such as <TT>firstlo</TT>.  The typo has been fixed.  The machine readable schedules
produced by SCHED&nbsp; to be sent to the antennas were not affected.
Fixed 3 Apr 2005 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>For Mark5 observations, SCHED&nbsp; was complaining when there were
too few tracks even if the setup was only for non-recording scans such
as those meant for reference pointing.  This test is now bypassed for
non-recording situations.  4 Apr. 2005 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Mark5 byte count was being accumulated even on non-recording
scans, such as pointing scans.  Corrected  4 Apr 2005 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change the reaction to the use of less than 8 tracks with Mark5
from an error to a warning on Walter Brisken's advice.  The data will
be recorded but, on the VLBA, extra dummy data will also be recorded
wasting disk space.  13 Apr 2005 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix the media specification in crd files for non-recording scans.
14 Apr 2005  RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Give information in the summary file about number of formatter
reconfigures and time lost to correlator resyncs.  Warn users when the
latter is over 10 percent of the total scan time.  We have seen some
projects lately where unfortunate frequency choices in band switching
projects led to many reconfigures and massive data loss.  In the process,
time lost to resyncs after tape stops is also calculated and a warning
is issued if it is excessive.  19 Apr 2005  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add <TT>DISK</TT> parameter to the <I>.oms</I> file.  It gives the
the number of Gbytes on the disk drive, if that has been calculated.
12 May 2005  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Remove joint tape and disk options even for VLBA. 27 June 2005 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Changed TPMODE to TAPEMODE in RECONFIG and SAMESET.  This is a bug
fix that might improve predictions of time lost to formatter reconfigures.
27 June 2005.  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Force TAPEMODE to 1 for disk so that constant track assignments
are kept.  Make some cosmetic modifications to the summary file related
to the conversion to Mark5. 29 June 2005.  RCW

<P>
</LI>
