<TT>PRECDATE</TT>
</H3>

<P>
The user provides SCHED&nbsp; with source coordinates in one of the J2000,
B1950, or DATE coordinate systems.  SCHED&nbsp; then determines the source
coordinates in the other systems.  The J2000 and B1950 systems are not
stationary with respect to each other.  To do a proper conversion, it
is necessary to specify for which date to do the conversion.  This
date is specified using <TT>PRECDATE</TT>.  When SCHED&nbsp; converts from,
for example, B1950 to J2000 coordinates, it uses the B1950 equations
to precess to <TT>PRECDATE</TT>, and then the J2000 equations to precess
from there to equinox 2000.  If the wrong date, by many years, is used,
the errors in the conversions will be a few tenths of an arc second.
This is enough to harm phasing of the VLA at high frequencies and
enough to be rather undesirable for positions used on the correlator.

<P>
The correct <TT>PRECDATE</TT> to use depends on various factors.  If the
target source coordinates are being provided in the J2000 system, as
they really should be, then it doesn't matter much.  The correlator
and the VLA will be given the J2000 positions so no conversion is
involved.  Some antennas will be given B1950 coordinates for pointing,
but for single dishes, the few tenths of an arcsecond differences that
can be caused by different <TT>PRECDATEs</TT> are not important.

<P>
The more important case is when the user has a B1950 coordinate for
the target source and wants SCHED&nbsp; to take care of the conversion to
J2000.  Then the correct <TT>PRECDATE</TT> should be used.  The correct
date depends on how the B1950 coordinates were measured.  If they
were determined based on absolute measurements made on some date,
that is the date that should be used.  However, most target source
positions will be based on measurements of offsets from some
calibrator.  Then the date that should be used depends on the nature
of the calibrator positions.  For example, the B1950 coordinates
of the VLA calibrators are either based on absolute measurements
made in 1979.9, or are converted from more modern J2000 coordinates
using an assumed ``observe'' date of 1979.9.  Therefore, any B1950
coordinates determined on the VLA using the B1950 coordinates of
sources in the VLA calibrator list should be precessed with a
<TT>PRECDATE</TT> of 1979.9, which is now the default in SCHED.  Note
that the 1979.9 date is hard-wired into the VLA scheduling program
OBSERVE and is not visible to the user.

<P>
Other systems may treat B1950 coordinates in a manner similer to the
VLA, but with a different reference date.  An obvious choice is
1950.0, which is used by MERLIN and is the default in the STARLINK
COCO precession routine.  On MERLIN, The calibrator positions
presumably are all based on measured positions originally determined
in J2000 (by VLBI etc), then converted to the B1950 coordinates that
are required by the on-line system.  Those conversions have all been
done assuming an ``observe'' date of 1950.0.  Thus, if you have B1950
source positions determined by offsets from a calibrator using MERLIN,
<TT>PRECDATE=1950.0</TT> should be used.

<P>
If anyone knows what other systems of general interest do, let
Craig Walker know and a section can be added here.

<P>
The default <TT>PRECDATE</TT> in SCHED&nbsp; has changed a few times over the
years.  Prior to 5 Aug 1997, a date of 1985.0 was hardwired into
the program.  After that, the user parameter was introduced with a
default of 1997.0.  On 6 May 1998, the default in the development
version of the code, and hence the next release (unknown date at this
writing) was changed to 1979.9, the VLA value.
