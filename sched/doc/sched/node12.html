Keyin Input for Plotting (obsolete)</A>
</H2>

<P>
This section describes the use of Keyin inputs to control the plotting
functions.  This has been superceeded by the control panel scheme
of inputs, but the documentation will be retained until the capability
is removed.

<P>
If the <TT>TERMINAL</TT> button is pressed on the plot control panel,
SCHED&nbsp; reverts to Keyin style input from the main window in which it
is running to control the plots.  First, SCHED&nbsp; writes a description
of the possible input parameters, which are also described below, and
then prompts for KEYIN style input.  The user should specify any
desired quantities and then type a ``/''.  If the user is on a machine
with X windows graphics, simply taking all the defaults will cause a
u-v plot of all sources and scans in the project to appear on the
screen.

<P>
The inputs can be used to choose between u-v plots, xy, and Ra-Dec
plots.  For u-v plots, the scale can be specified and a station can be
selected for which, on color displays, the baselines to that station
will be highlighted (displayed in red).  Also the source to be plotted
can be specified.  XY plots are a bit more complicated because they
are more flexible.  The quantity to plot on each axis can be selected,
the scales specified and the station and source chosen to be one or
all.  See the details of the input parameters below.  In addition, the
plot can be restricted to scans that use one of the setup files.  This
can be useful for assessing band switching observations.

<P>
The input parameters are not reset between runs of the plotting.  Thus
the user need only specify those items that he/she wishes to change.
Some of the built in KEYIN capabilities can be useful here.  If you
type <TT>SHOW</TT> (and "/"????, KEYIN will list the input variables
and their current values.  <TT>HELP</TT> generates a list of the variables.
Also you can type <TT>SAVE filename</TT> and KEYIN will write a file with
name <TT>filename</TT> in the default area containing the current parameter
settings.  Later, perhaps in another run of SCHED, you can type
<TT>@filename</TT> to recover those parameters.  The parameter file can
be edited -- it is a normal KEYIN input file (actually any file can
be read with the <TT>@filename</TT> construct, although only up to the first
``/'').

<P>
Plotting Input Parameters (Terminal):

<P>
The KEYIN inputs to the plotting section of SCHED&nbsp; are:

<P>
<TT>PLotfile</TT>

<P>
<TT>PLOTfile</TT> gives the output specification for the plot.  As with
any PGPLOT programs, it is in the form <TT>filename/device</TT>.
For interactive devices, the filename need not be specified.  The
default device is <TT>/xs</TT> which is a good choice for X windows systems.
Other devices most likely to be of interest are <TT>/ps</TT> for a postscript
file and <TT>/cps</TT> for a color postscript file.  See
<A NAME="tex2html55"
  HREF="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/">PGPLOT documentation</A>PGPLOT
documentation for other options (more will be listed here in the future).
The device can be changed at any time.
If it is changed, the old one will be closed and the new one opened.  This
allows the plot to be set up interactively, and then put out in postscript
for printing.

<P>
<TT>SEtnum</TT>

<P>
When the plotting section is entered the first time, information is written
to the screen about possible input options.  Among the information presented
is a numbered list of the setup files encountered in the input.  With
<TT>SEtnum</TT>, one of those setup files can be selected by number (avoids
lots of typing since setup file names often include full paths and can
be quite long).  Then the plot will only show scans which use that setup
file.

<P>
<TT>TYpe</TT>

<P>
<TT>TYpe</TT> is used to specify the type of plot.  The option are <TT>UV</TT>,
which is the default, <TT>XY</TT>, and <TT>RD</TT>.  <TT>UV</TT> causes a plot of the
spatial frequency coverage to be plotted.  For now, the scale on the
plot is km.  An expected enhancement eventually is for this to optionally
be in wavelengths.  For <TT>XY</TT> plots, there are a variety of options
which are specified with <TT>XAxis</TT> and <TT>YAxis</TT>, which independently
specify the quatantity plotted on each axis.  <TT>RD</TT> requests that the
locations of the sources in the schedule be plotted in Ra and Dec.

<P>
<TT>XAxis</TT>

<P>
<TT>XAxis</TT> specifies the quantity to be plotted on the horizontal axis
in a <TT>TYPE=XY</TT> plot.  The options are <TT>el</TT> for elevation, <TT>az</TT> for azimuth, <TT>pa</TT> for paralactic angle (for polarization),
<TT>ha</TT> for hour angle, <TT>ut</TT> for universal time, and <TT>gst</TT> for
Greenwich Sidereal time.

<P>
<TT>YAxis</TT>

<P>
<TT>YAxis</TT> specifies the quantitiy to be plotted on the vertical axis
in a <TT>TYPE=XY</TT> plot. The options are <TT>el</TT> for elevation, <TT>az</TT> for azimuth, <TT>pa</TT> for paralactic angle, and <TT>ha</TT> for hour
angle.  If <TT>xaxis=az</TT> and <TT>yaxis=el</TT>, the antenna horizons
will be plotted along with the source tracks.

<P>
<TT>XLeft</TT> and <TT>XRight</TT>

<P>
<TT>XLeft</TT> and <TT>XRight</TT> specify the minimum and maximum for the
X axis plot scale.  If they are not set, or are set to -9999., the axis will
be autoscaled.  For u-v plots, it is only necessary to specify one
value, say <TT>XMax</TT>, and it will be used for all 4 limits.  If more
than one are specified, they are used which allows off center plots.
For <TT>XY</TT> plots, the limits should be specified in the units of
the plots.  For the time axis, the limits should be in the form
<TT>hh:mm:ss</TT> where this is the time offset since the beginning of the
first day of the experiment for <TT>UT</TT> or is the GST.  Note for u-v
plots, traditionaly, the plot has positive to the left so <TT>XLeft</TT> will
be greater than <TT>XRight</TT>.  For Ra-Dec plots, <TT>XLeft</TT> and <TT>XRight</TT>
specify the RA range and should be in the form <TT>hh:mm:ss</TT> (eg.
<TT>XL = 5:30:00</TT>).

<P>
<TT>YBottom</TT> and <TT>YTop</TT>

<P>
<TT>YBottom</TT> and <TT>YTop</TT> specify the minimum and maximum for the Y
axis plot scale.  If they are not set, or are set to -9999., the axis will
be autoscaled.  For Ra-Dec plots, <TT>YBottom</TT> and <TT>YTop</TT> specify
the declination limits and should be in the form <TT>dd:mm:ss</TT> (eg.
<TT>YB = -12:15:00</TT>).

<P>
<TT>SOurce</TT>

<P>
<TT>SOurce</TT> can be used to restrict the plots to a single source.  The
default, which can be specified at any time is <TT>ALL</TT>, which will
cause all sources to be plotted.

<P>
<TT>STation</TT>

<P>
<TT>STation</TT> can be used to restrict <TT>TYPE=XY</TT> plots to one station.
For <TT>TYPE=UV</TT> plots, all stations will be plotted, but all baselines
to the specified station will be plotted in a contrasting color.
The default, which may be specified at any time, is <TT>ALL</TT>, which
will cause all stations to be plotted or not highlighted.

<P>
<TT>REstart</TT>

<P>
See the discussion above for details of the effect of <TT>REstart</TT>.  In
short, it causes the program to return to the beginning and reread the
input, which may have changed.

<P>
<TT>FInish</TT>

<P>
<TT>FInish</TT> tells SCHED&nbsp; to close the plot files and produce the
station specific output files.  <TT>FInish</TT> is locked out after a
<TT>REstart</TT> to make absolutely sure that the output files really
correspond to what is in the schedule file.  If <TT>REstart</TT> has
been used, it will be necessary to <TT>EXit</TT> and rerun SCHED&nbsp; from
scratch to get the station output files.

<P>
<TT>EXit</TT>

<P>
<TT>EXIT</TT> tells SCHED&nbsp; to close the plot files and exit.  Antenna
specific files will not be produced.
