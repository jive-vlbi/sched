Overview
</H1>

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; is a program for scheduling Very Long Baseline Interferometer
(VLBI) Observations.  It can be used to schedule any observations on
antennas that use the VLBA real time control software and to schedule
Mark IV/VLBA(4)/S2/Mark5 observations on any stations that can read
VEX format schedules.  It can also be used for scheduling many types
of VLA observations.  SCHED&nbsp; is the program used to schedule
essentially all non-geodetic VLBA projects and has been adopted by the
European VLBI Network (EVN) and the VSOP orbiting VLBI satellite
project as the standard scheduling program for those systems.  SCHED&nbsp; 
is also a useful tool for planning observations, both at proposal
writing time and before making detailed schedules.  The plotting
capabilities are especially useful for this.

<P>
To use SCHED, one normally creates an input file, using any text
editor, that describes the schedule.  Then SCHED&nbsp; is run on that
file.  A number of <A HREF="node8.html#SEC:EXAMPLES">examples</A> are distributed
with SCHED.  The usual and recommended way to make a schedule is to
copy one of the examples and modify it according to your specific
needs.  When developing a schedule, it is likely that SCHED&nbsp; will be
run several times before everything is to the scheduler's
satisfaction.  The various output files, especially the summary file
and the optional <A HREF="node11.html#SEC:PLOT">plots</A>, provide a lot of
information about the schedule that can be used to help the user with
optimization.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; gets a lot of information, including station locations and
equipment, source positions, and frequency setups, from a number of
catalogs.  Most catalogs can be imbedded in the schedule, but it is
much more common to use the standard ones provided with the SCHED&nbsp; 
distribution.  An effort has been made to put as much information as
possible in the catalogs so that the user only need provide very
generic information specific to the particular project.  But if the
user wants to do something special, it is possible to specify the
parameters of an observation in great detail.  Documenting all these
capabilities partially explains the large size of this manual, most
of which is not needed by the average user.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; writes several different types of output files, some of which
are useful for the scheduler and some of which are meant for the
computers at the antennas.  An outline of the files used by SCHED&nbsp; 
can be found in <A HREF="node7.html#SEC:FILES">the section on files.</A>.  The summary file is the most important one for
the user.  It gives the details of the equipment setups at each
station and a summary of various items about the individual scans.

<P>
The beginning user might start by looking at one or more of the
<A HREF="node8.html#SEC:EXAMPLES">example files</A> to get a sense of what they look
like.  Then read some of the sections that cover important details,
without which it might be difficult to understand what is going on.
The section on <A HREF="node6.html#SEC:KEYIN">KEYIN Free Format Input</A> covers the capabilities and limitations
of the parser used to read all input files.  The section on
<A HREF="node7.html#SEC:FILES">Input and Output files</A> gives an overview of the information that SCHED&nbsp; 
requires.  <A HREF="node290.html#SEC:RUNSCHED">The Running SCHED&nbsp; section</A> has instructions on how to start the program.  And
<A HREF="node8.html#SEC:EXAMPLES">the Examples section</A>
contains 2 examples of SCHED&nbsp; input files and quick descriptions of,
and links to, most of the rest provided with the distribution.

<P>
After reading the sections recommended above, it would probably be
best to use one of the examples to experiment with the program.  The
examples are complete, working files.  In fact, they are all used
regularily to test SCHED&nbsp; modifications.  They will work as is, and
it can be modified to try other features.  The easiest way to make a
schedule for your project will usually be to select the example that
is closest to what you are trying to do and modify it to your needs.
It is not strictly necessary to read the rest of the manual.  It can
be treated as a reference to help answer questions.

<P>
The files needed to run SCHED&nbsp; are in various subdirectories under
the base directory used for the SCHED&nbsp; installation.  That base
directory, on unix systems, should be assigned by you or your system
administrators to the environment variable <I>SCHED</I>.  The key
subdirectories are <I>examples</I>, <I>setups</I>, <I>catalogs</I>, <I>doc</I>, <I>src</I>, and <I>bin</I> and can be refered to, on unix systems,
using paths such as <I>$SCHED/catalogs</I>.  For most the contents are
obvious from the names.  <I>src</I> contains the code and <I>bin</I>
contains the executables, perhaps in architecture dependent
subdirectories.  The user should work in a private directory and only
refer to files in the SCHED&nbsp; standard areas, not modify them.  All
SCHED&nbsp; output files are written in the current working directory.

<P>
There is a lot of information about SCHED&nbsp; and about the process of
scheduling VLBI observations in the descriptions of the <A HREF="node50.html#SEC:SCHPAR">input parameters</A> and of
the <A HREF="node229.html#SSEC:SETLST">parameters for the setup files</A>.  There are detailed discussions of
some specific areas of concern in the <A HREF="node15.html#SEC:TIPS">Scheduling Tips
Section </A>.  This is a section
that will be expanded significantly in the future.  All of these
sections are worth reading through on some slow day for those serious
about scheduling.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; is not the same program as PC-SCHED. That program, which
was written at Haystack, is the primary program for scheduling of
Mark&nbsp;III observations.  The VLBA staff (or any user) can convert the
DRUDG file from PC-SCHED (or SKED) into a SCHED&nbsp; 
input file using SKEDCONV.  This is the standard way in which
VLBA and VLA control files are produced for Mark&nbsp;III programs.  But
such programs are rare because the Mark&nbsp;III system has been almost
totally replaced by the Mark&nbsp;IV system for which SCHED&nbsp; can write
schedules.  VLBI projects can also be produced using the NASA Goddard
program SKED and VLBA control files can be produced using DRUDG.  That is the standard path used by the geodesy community, but
is rare among astronomers.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; may be obtained by anonymous ftp from <I>ftp.aoc.nrao.edu</I>
under directory <I>pub/sched</I>.  For more information, see the
section on <A HREF="node289.html#SEC:INSTALL">Installing SCHED.</A>  Users are encouraged to obtained the current release
of SCHED&nbsp; before attempting to make schedules.  The program is
continually evolving to support new features and to make it harder
to write schedules that won't work.  It is in your own best interests
to have the current version.  For most users, installing a new
version should involve little more than copying and unpacking the tar
files and copying the executable for their type of machine.

<P>
A note on notation: the names of computer programs will be given in
SMALL CAPS font, the names of files will appear in <I>slant</I>
font, and the names of SCHED&nbsp; and setup file parameters will
appear in <TT>typewriter</TT> font. Some parameters may be abbreviated;
where both compulsory and optional characters are displayed, the
compulsory ones will be shown in <TT>UPPER-CASE TYPEWRITER</TT> font and
the optional ones shown in <TT>lower-case typewriter</TT> font.
