SCHED&nbsp; Input and Output Files
</H1>

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; takes input from several types of files in addition to any
interactive input.  All of these files can be separate, as long as
SCHED&nbsp; can find them, or most of them can be imbedded in the main
input file.  The former is more convenient.  But, when the input file
is to be sent somewhere else to be run again, it may be safer to imbed
the catalog information in the main file.  All input to SCHED&nbsp; is in
the <A HREF="node6.html#SEC:KEYIN">keyin free format</A>.  This is the same format as is used by all Caltech VLBI
package programs.  The input file types are:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="node50.html#SEC:SCHPAR">Main Schedule Input File</A>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the
file that contains the details of the particular project.  It can have
the most of the other files imbedded in it.  This file must be created
by the user.  This file should be given a name like <I>bv016.key</I>
for project BV016.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="node196.html#SEC:SRCCAT">Source Catalog</A>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This file contains the
information about the sources, especially names, positions, and, for
line sources, velocities.  There are standard source catalogs,
although the user may need to add non-standard sources.  Source
catalog entries can be included in the <A HREF="node50.html#SEC:SCHPAR">Main Schedule Input
File</A>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="node197.html#SEC:STACAT">Station Catalog</A>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This file contains
information about the antennas including names, positions, slew
limits, horizons etc.  There is a standard station catalog that should
suffice for nearly all users.  If not, entries can be included in
the <A HREF="node50.html#SEC:SCHPAR">Main Schedule Input File</A>.  Station positions
may stored sparately in the <A HREF="node197.html#SEC:STACAT">Location Catalog</A>

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="node197.html#SEC:STACAT">Location Catalog</A>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This file contains
station locations.  The standard version reflects the locations and
velocities used on the VLBA correlator.  It is documented along with
the [<A HREF="node197.html#SEC:STACAT">Station Catalog</A> because they are tightly
coupled.  The Locations Catalog is optional since it is not needed if
the station locations are specified in the Station Catalog.  It exists
separately for ease of maintenance.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="node213.html#SEC:SETUPS">Setup Files</A>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These files contain the
details required to configure the hardware at the stations.  Different
projects using the same hardware configuration can use the same setup
files.  There are many standard setup files.  Setup file names
conventionally end in <I>.set</I>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="node211.html#SEC:FRQCAT">Frequency Catalog</A>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This file contains
information about valid frequency setups at the stations.  The RF
ranges that can be covered and the local oscillator and polarization
of each IF are given.  SCHED&nbsp; can use this information to provide
good defaults for many parameters in the setup files.  The standard
file should be used.  Any non-standard information can be in the setup
files.  This file cannot be imbedded in the main input file.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="node198.html#SEC:TPINI">Tape Initialization File</A>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This file tells
SCHED&nbsp; the properties of the tape systems at the stations and where
to start on each tape.  For most experiments, the default tape
initialization parameters will be adequate and this file need not be
provided.  The main exceptions are observations using thick tapes
at some sites.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="node37.html#SEC:REFPOINT">Reference Pointing Control File</A>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>SCHED&nbsp; can insert scans for reference pointing at high frequencies
on the VLBA and VLA.  This file contains information needed to
control that function.  It will only be of interest for observations
at 43 GHz on the VLA and at 86 GHz on the VLBA.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="node36.html#SEC:LINE">Spectral Line Rest Frequencies</A>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>SCHED&nbsp; can adjust the observing frequency to remove the doppler
shifts due to the motions of the Earth around the Sun and to
the Sun with respect to a desired reference frame.  To do this,
SCHED&nbsp; needs to know the rest frequency of the line being
observed.  This is given in a <TT>lineinit</TT> section imbedded
either in the main file or in the reference pointing control file.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; processes the input files and creates several output
files.  Most follow a naming convention where that starts with
the project code (BV016 will be used in the examples here) followed
by a file type indicator, then a period, then a two letter station
code (pt for Pie Town in the examples below).  The experiment code
is read by SCHED&nbsp; in the <A HREF="node89.html#MP:EXPCODE"><TT>EXPCODE</TT></A> parameter
in the main schedule input.  The station code comes from the
<A HREF="node197.html#SEC:STACAT">station catalog</A> and a list if given in
Appendix <A HREF="node312.html#APP:STACODES">A.4</A>. The output files are:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Summary File:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This file gives a rather extensive summary of the
setups and observations.  This is the most useful output file for the
user as it shows how SCHED&nbsp; has interpreted the input commands.  The
file will be called, for example, <I>bv016.sum</I>.  The items displayed
for each scan can be controlled with the parameter <A HREF="node174.html#MP:SUMITEM"><TT>SUMITEM</TT></A>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>sched.runlog:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This file reflects most of what you see on the
screen when SCHED&nbsp; is running, plus may contain additional messages
that help debug problems should they occur.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Operator Schedule Files:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These files, of which there is one per
antenna, give much information the schedule than can be included in
the summary file and are useful when that level of detail is needed.
They were originally meant for the use of operators of manually
controlled antennas, but now most antennas are computer controlled and
these files are more useful for the scheduler.  The files are named,
for example, <I>bv016sch.pt</I>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>VLBA type Antenna Control Files:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These files provide
the on-line control systems of the type found at VLBA antennas with
the information they need to control the observations.  There is one
file per antenna that uses a VLBA control computer for either full
control of the station or for control of just the data aquisition
system (tape drives, baseband converters etc.).  The files are named,
for example, <I>bv016crd.pt</I>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Other Antenna Control Files:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These files are
antenna control files in VLA observe deck format, Green Bank Card
format, or SNAP (Mark III style, but SCHED&nbsp; can make them
for Mark II only).  Some antennas, such as the VLA, require both
crd. and obs. files.  The files are named, for example, <I>bv016obs.y</I> for the VLA file.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Mark IV .skd Files in VEX format:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These are the files needed
  for stations under control of the Goddard ``Field System'', e.g.   MkIV telescopes.  Writing of such files is available in SCHED&nbsp; 
  (depending on switches in the Makefile).  Reading of such files, in
  order to make control files for the VLBA, will be added later.  They
  will be named, for example, <I>bv016.skd</I>.  A single such file
  describes the observations for all antennas.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Flag file:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>SCHED&nbsp; writes a file with the <I>.flag</I> extension
that can be helpful in data processing.  It contains flag entries,
in the format appropriate for the AIPS task UVFLG, that cover the
times when the tape is moving, but the antenna is expected to be
slewing.  For the VLBA, the monitor flags would take care of such
times, but for other types of stations, such information is not
always available from the logs.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Plots:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Sched can make plots of u-v coverage and of various
combinations of azimuth, elevation, paralactic angle, hour angle,
UT, and GST against each other.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Optimized Schedule:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When one of SCHED's optimization modes
is turned on, the program writes out a file, such as <I>bv016.sch</I>
containing the basic scan inputs for a new main schedule file.  If
desired, the user can use this to construct, and perhaps modify,
a new optimized main schedule input.  This used to be the way all
optimized schedules were constructed, but now that SCHED&nbsp; fully
processes an optimized schedule, it is rarely used or needed.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>frequencies.list</I>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the user specifies the parameter
<A HREF="node96.html#MP:FREQLIST"><TT>FREQLIST</TT></A>, SCHED&nbsp; will read the
frequency catalog and make a table of all known setups which can
be used to make observations in the specified frequency range.  Then
SCHED&nbsp; will quit without doing further processing.  This is useful
for planning and for information while making setup files.
