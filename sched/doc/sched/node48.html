Satellite Tracking
</H1>

<P>
There is a project to use the VLBA to provide positional data to help
navigate interplanetary spacecraft.  For this project, the VLBA must
be able to point at the spacecraft so the ability to do so has been
added to SCHED&nbsp; as of March 2004.  The spacecraft positions are
obtained with the help of <I>spice</I> files that are typically from
JPL.  The NAIF software package from JPL is called to read the spice
files and calculate positions.  The NAIF software significantly
increases the size of a SCHED&nbsp; distribution, and the satellite
tracking capability is unlikely to be needed outside the AOC.
Therefore the tracking capability is not included in the default
SCHED&nbsp; distribution.

<P>
To use the tracking capability, a <A HREF="node272.html#SEC:SATINIT"><TT>Satellite
Initialization</TT></A> section needs to be included in the
main input file.  That section contains a group of inputs for each
satellite.  There are four input parameters in each group:

<P>
Note that the satellite routines also set the velocity for the
satellite for use with <A HREF="node78.html#MP:DOPPLER"><TT>DOPPLER</TT></A>.
The satellite frequencies can be specified with their rest frequencies
in a <A HREF="node111.html#MP:LINEINIT"><TT>LINEINIT</TT></A> section.

<P>

<OL>
<LI><TT>SATNAME:</TT> The name of the satellite.  This is only used internally
in SCHED.  It is the name that should be used as the <TT>SOURCE</TT> in
the scan inputs.  This name is not sent to the NAIF software.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>SATNUM:</TT> The number, used in the spice files, for the satellite (or
other celestial body, for that matter).  This number is assigned by JPL.
You need to know this number but I'm not really sure how you get it.
This number is sent to the NAIF software to tell it which satellite to
process.  For satellites, these numbers are negative.  The are positive
for planets etc.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>KERFILE:</TT> A <I>spice</I> kernel file that gives information such
as leap seconds.  It is likely to have the extension <I>.tls</I>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>SATFILE:</TT> The <I>spice</I> file for the satellite.  It is likely
to have the extension <I>.bsp</I>.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
When groups have been given for all satellites, give a line that
contains the word <TT>ENDSAT</TT> and a slash.

<P>
If the above section is provided and one of the satellites is a source
in the schedule, SCHED&nbsp; will call the NAIF software every scan to
get updated positions and rates.  It will also calculate an approximate
parallax correction for each station.  This can amount to several
arcseconds, and the calculation is believed to be good to an arcsecond
or better.

<P>
For a satellite (or any moving source, for that matter), SCHED&nbsp; plotting
can help you see where the object is going.  In the RD (RA/Dec) plots,
a line will be plotted for each scan.  A likely use for this capability
would be to obtain the transmission schedule for a satellite over some
days or weeks, make a schedule with a scan for each period that it
is transmitting, then make the RD plot and show the calibrators.  This
will help identify times when the satellite is both on and near
a likely phase reference source.

<P>
There is a SCHED&nbsp; example, <A NAME="tex2html69"
  HREF="examples/egsat.key"><I>egsat.com</I></A>
that demonstrates the use of the satellite
capability.  Interested users are recommended to start with that
example.
