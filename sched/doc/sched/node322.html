<P>
This is a list of desired program changes, fixes or enhancements.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Change SUMITEM defaults now that tapes are no longer (soon) in use.
      Request by Amy Mioduszewski  June 7, 2006.  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Improve specification of multiple pass processing.  And force 
      specification when it is clear that multiple pass will be needed.
      Analysts  May 4, 2006.  See email from lfoley for details.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Try to force more care in specifying origin of source coordinates.
      Analysts  May 4, 2006.  See email from lfoley for details.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Put the grab time stuff in for Walter.  See $SCHED/vlbagrab.txt

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Need new OBSTYPE or get rid of OBSTYPE.  Old note  Jan 26, 2006.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add Sec(Z) to the plot options.  From George Moellenbrock.  Nov. 14,
      2005.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Supersimple setup parameters (band and bit rate).  From Jodrell
      discussions in Nov 2004 Dec 29, 2004

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VLBA takes about 1s to respond to commands.  Use prestart=1
      for Mark5?  Noted by Walter B.  Dec 19, 2004.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change autoallocate default?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Source dependent elevation limits for configuration studies.
      Request by Pat Crane.  Aug 2. 2004 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Put an Az/El raster option in Sched.  From note Jul 2004 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Take into account GBT band change time.  From note Jul 2004 RCW
      Discussed at Jodrell in Nov 2004.  This will probably take a
      matrix input for each agile station.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Get FIFMIN and MAX for user setups VLA and VLBA.  From note, Jul
      2004 RCW.  This has to do with sensing when you get outside the
      IF.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>OPTMINANT and OPTMINEL don't work with MODE UPTIME.  From note,
      Jul 2004 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Do more for VLBA4 DAR;  Add SiO to VLA freq.dat; Turn off pcal
      at VLA.  From note, Jul 2004 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>High resolution RD plots of Mars vs orbiters affected by
      diurnal paralax.  Also planet not plotted if start point not on
      field.  From note, Jul 2004  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Calculate range of acceptable dates based on solar distance for
      dynamically scheduled projects.  From Mat Lister 6/17/2004.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make S2 default tape length appropriate. Now it is for VLBA/MarkIV.
      See May 2004 email from Chris Phillips.  30 Jul 2004 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make tape and disk the default for VLBA if catalog says they have
      both.  From note Jul 2004 RCW.  Check with Walter.  May not be
      current desire.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If PCALs are turned off, then back on, warn that they do not
      return to the same phase.  24 Nov 2003 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The VLA has a filter in front of P band that cuts it off at
      305 and 335 MHz.  SCHED is not aware of it.  Fix that.  24 Sep 2003
      RCW.  (consult Ken Sowinski)  Maybe don't use the "front end
      filter at all since this other filter is earlier and is only
      30 MHz.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>More than 5 aliases for sources.  There are already 2 sources
      in the correlator data base with 6.  15Sept2003  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Survey optimizer

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Plotting options:

<P>
Add UV plot scale option in wavelengths.  Allow channel
      selection for plot.

<P>
For beam, get beam size and some sidelobe statistics.

<P>
21 Feb 2002 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow control of peakup channel when using autopeak.  21nov2001

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Deal with DSN patching scheme.  Also Mark IV geodetic patching.
      15 Oct 2001  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The various DAR types need better documentation.  19sep2001 RCW.
      For example, VLBAG is not documented.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Have some scheme to test for allowed band switching at antennas
      that have partial capabilities.  This is coming on the EVN.
      Also deal with availability of more than one receiver at a band.
      21 June 2001  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When two aliases are used for the same source in a schedule, there
      are some oddities.  A .skd file ends up with two source sections,
      of which one is empty.  The plotting acts like there are two sources,
      but all the plotted info is under one of them.  4 Apr 2001.  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Model frequency change times now that more antennas are getting
      multiple band capability.  For example, on GBT it is time to
      point to zenith, 1 minute to rotate, and point again - up to
      9 minutes.  Switching from Gregorian to prime focus is about
      5 minutes.  So far SCHED&nbsp; assumes either that it happens so
      fast that is doesn't really matter (VLBA) or so slow that it
      is not done during an observation (manual box change).
      8Dec2000 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Check reasonableness of requested correlator average time for
      Socorro correlator.  Tavg=speedup*.131072*n.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Calculate data rates with mixed integration times.  Will need
      stations specified.  13dec99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make a USUBA input file if there is any subarraying.
      16nov99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add an optimizing mode for startup pointing that cycles through
      the frequencies as fast as possible.  Perhaps takes highest
      elevation source for each setup as it cycles through setups.
      8Jun98 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add LEVEL to scan parameters.  27may98 RCW and Bryan Butler.
      It is already a setup parameter.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Warn of times of low fringe rate when the pulse cal tones
      might correlate.  15apr98  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Warn about CALCODE=G meaning the pulsar gate will be used.
      From paper note  8apr98 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow station dependent minimum tape change times.  Mar 98.
      Include variable times for postpass (EB on slow now).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow scans to abut with dwell time scheduling if there is
      no change of source or setup.  Worry about not messing up
      foreign stations that need setup time.  July97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Check that the total times etc are correct with subarrays.
      Someone thinks that they are not.  June97 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Go to 16 character source names?  Now 12.  Early97

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Do something about the long reconfigure time when the PCX
      frequencies change (23 seconds).  Early97

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add PCAL tone frequency check.  Early97

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Networks:  For stations that don't have pulse cal injectors (eg VLA),
      use pulse cal detectors to get state counts.  23jan98.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Networks:  Add checks related to special requirements at many stations.
      An example is the need for time for peaking scans at GB.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VEX:  Add VEX input.  Big ticket item!  Not needed as long as DRUDG
      can handle VLBA antennas for geodesy and all other users
      use SCHED.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>MarkIV:  Calcodes and Qualifiers need to get to correlator either
      directly or through all station logs.  The field system
      stations don't do it now.  They probably should.  Nov97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>MarkIV:  Get MarkIV two head track and head position assignments
      right.  I'm sure they aren't now.  July97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VLA:  Have a better model of slew times.  Probably need to account
      for actions happening on 10s LST boundaries.  Also know setup times.
      Might be needed for phase referencing.  8may98. RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VLA:  Protect against more than 500 MHz spread in frequencies (shared
      L1) at the VLA.  Early 97.
      Force the sharing of L1. (figure this out).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VLA:  Some sort of DWELL time scheduling for VLA phasing
      is needed.  Basically, deal with slew times to calibrators.  Early97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VLA:  Support fast switching.  Early97

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VLA:  Need horzontal paralax for PM card.  Can get from
      distance.  Early97

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VLA:  Add all other VLA cards for fully capable VLA scheduling.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VLA:  Cannot use frequency catalog for VLA only observations.
      Can this be changed?  3Jul97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
