MARK&nbsp;IV
</H2>

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; supports Mark&nbsp;IV observations on Mark&nbsp;IV (and VLBA4) antennas
equipped with the Field System (PCFS). This is done by creating a <TT>*.skd</TT> file in the VEX format. The VEX file is a global and
self-contained description of the experiment that is scheduled. The
<TT>*.skd</TT> file can be read by the control system (PCFS) and
translated (by a program called D<SMALL>RUDG</SMALL>) into a list of commands
for the telescope, data acquisition system and recorder.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; produces VEX files with ``adaptive'' tape control that enables
continuous tape motion on PCFS controled telescopes, but can only
be correctly interpreted by FS9.3.11 (and higher).

<P>
In order to cause SCHED&nbsp; to write VEX files, the user must either
include in the schedule one telescope for which <TT>CONTROL = VEX</TT> is
specified in the <A HREF="node197.html#SEC:STACAT">station catalog</A> or must specify
the input parameter <A HREF="node81.html#MP:DOVEX"><TT>DOVEX</TT></A>.
Two example schedules that produce VEX files are included with the
SCHED&nbsp; distribution and are located in the <I>$SCHED/examples</I>
subdirectory.  They are called <I>egiv.key</I> and <I>egvsop.key</I>.

<P>
Mark&nbsp;IV (MkIV) telescopes are characterized by <TT>DAR = MKIV</TT> and
<TT>RECORDER = MKIV </TT> in the <A HREF="node197.html#SEC:STACAT">station catalog</A>
and can only be requested to record in any of the MkIV FORMATs. Most
MkIV telescopes only support specific BBC's to be connected to certain
IF distribution boxes. Currently SCHED&nbsp; only supports ``astronomical
patching''. This requires odd BBC's to be connected to either <TT>IFCHAN = 1N</TT> (normal input, usually LCP) or <TT>IFCHAN = 1A</TT>
(alternate, usually RCP). Even BBC's have to be connected to <TT>IFCHAN = 2N</TT> (usually RCP) or <TT>IFCHAN = 2A</TT> for LCP. This can be
controlled by explicitly setting <TT>BBC</TT>.

<P>
In December 2000 the capability to record 512 Mb/s was introduced.
This is achieved by recording 64 tracks simultaneously.  It requires
<TT>NHEADS = 2</TT> in the station catalogue. Many MkIV stations now
record using the Mk5 disk-based system. MkIV Stations equipped with
Mk5 systems can record data at up to 1&nbsp;Gbps. This requires <TT>DISK =
MARK5A</TT> in the station catalogue.

<P>
Several features are not yet available or supported for MkIV (and MarkIV
based Mark5 systems).  Some as of late 2004 are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Continuous tape motion has been used widely, however the ability
  to acquire the information needed to flag data which is recorded during
  slewing is not universal. The SCHED&nbsp; output .flg file can be used
  by the AIPS task <TT>UVFLG</TT>.  In addition users need to insert gaps
  during continuous tape motion whenever they want calibration data.
  Finally, at least 40 seconds are required to turn the tape around.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Phase Cal detection at the telescopes is not implemented at all
  telescopes. This
  requires soft- and hardware upgrades at the telescopes,
  the field system, and probably SCHED.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>For MkIV (VLBA4) telescopes there is flexibility for controling
  when Tsys measurements will be made. Tsys measurements will typically
  be made at the beginning of a scan if there is a tape stop. When
  scheduling long scans or continuous tape motions, one may need to
  insert gaps in order to obtain Tsys data.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
SCHED has the ability to discourage recording modes that are not
supported by one or the other of the VLBA or Mark&nbsp;IV (VLBA4) systems.
Currently (Oct. 2001) the supported modes on both systems are the same
so this facility has no effect, except for some Mark&nbsp;IV (and VLBA4)
features that are experimental. An override (<A HREF="node243.html#SP:MODETEST"><TT>MODETEST</TT></A>) is available but should be used with caution.

<P>
In addition to requiring use of tested modes, SCHED&nbsp; will not
allow speedup factor changes during mixed VLBA and Mark&nbsp;IV mode
observations.  This is because of tape speed dependent delays that
are different in the two formats.  The correlator would require
different clocks for different modes, which is not yet available.
Fairly soon, this restriction will be relaxed.  Again, MODETEST will
turn off the test.

<P>
Eventually it will be required that NRAO have some way to read Mark&nbsp;IV
VEX format <TT>*.skd</TT> files and produce VLBA control files.  This
might be done using VEX input to SCHED&nbsp; or by supporting general
types of observations with DRUDG, which already serves this
function for geodesy projects.  Probably nothing will be done in this
area until some program other than SCHED starts being used for general
VLBA scheduling.
