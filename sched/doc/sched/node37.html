Reference Pointing
</H1>

<P>
At high observing frequencies, it can be difficult to point antennas with
sufficient accuracy to keep the target source in the beam.  On tactic to
improve this situation is known as reference pointing.  The idea is to
peak up the pointing on a source prior to the VLBI scan.  The source can
be the target source, if it is sufficiently strong.  Otherwise it can
be another source.  It is best to find a source as close as possible
to the target, but it may be necessary to go tens of degrees to find
one that is suitable.  The reference pointing is commonly done at a
lower frequency than the interferometer observations for improved SNR.

<P>
Reference pointing is commonly used at the VLBA for observations at
3mm.  The actual pointing observations are typically done at 7mm where
the sensitivity is greater and the beam is a larger.  The pointing
offsets are determined by the on-line system by fitting total power
measurements made while the antenna is moved over a pattern that
includes the nominal on-source, half power, and off-source positions.
Often this is done on strong SiO maser sources.  One minute should be
allowed for completion of this pattern after the antenna reaches the
pointing source.  Once a pointing offset has been determined, it will
be used until another is determined, or the project changes.  It
cannot be turned off.  Optimal time intervals between pointing scans
and maximum offsets to pointing sources are not yet known.  But
pointing every half hour to hour on sources within about 20 degrees
should be ok.

<P>
Because total power mode is being used for VLBA pointing, sources must
be very strong -- more than about 10 Jy for continuum sources or
about the same flux density averaged over the observing bandwidth for
line sources (peak Ta of about 2 K).  Very few continuum sources are
strong enough, so most appropriate sources are SiO masers observed with
restricted bandwidth, usually 2 MHz, centered on the line.  See the
sample pointing command file <A NAME="tex2html57"
  HREF="catalogs/peak.cmd"><I>$SCHED/catalogs/peak.cmd</I></A>, provided with the
SCHED&nbsp; catalogs and discussed below, for a list of possible targets.
Most of the SiO line sources are variable.  The ones in <I>peak.cmd</I>
were thought to be good at the time the file was made.
Information on masers can be found at the <A NAME="tex2html58"
  HREF="http://www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/Telescopes/SEST/html/telescope-calibration/index.html">SEST web
site</A>.
Some information on continuum sources at mm wavelengths can be found
at the
<A NAME="tex2html59"
  HREF="http://www.ovro.caltech.edu/mm/preobs/sched97.html#phasecal">OVRO</A>.

<P>
Reference pointing is commonly used for 7mm observations on the VLA.
It is done interferometer mode at X band (4cm) and so can only be done
when more than one antenna is available to the observer.  VLBI
projects with only one VLA antenna (Y1) cannot use reference pointing.
Since interferometer mode is used, only on-source and half-power
pointing positions are needed.  But the pattern is slower, taking
about 2.5 minutes.  See the discussion of <A HREF="node190.html#MP:VLAPEAK"><TT>VLAPEAK</TT></A> for more details.  Intervals between pointing
observations should again be half to one hour and the source should
be within about 15 degrees of the target.  Continuum calibrators above
about 0.5 Jy at 8 GHz are appropriate, so there are far more available
than for the VLBA.

<P>
Reference pointing scans can be inserted explicitly by the observer or
SCHED&nbsp; can be requested to attempt to do the job automatically.  For
explicit scan insertion, the user specifies a scan with times and a
source.  Other factors such as the setup can also be specified.  The
parameters <A HREF="node138.html#MP:PEAK"><TT>PEAK</TT></A> and/or <A HREF="node190.html#MP:VLAPEAK"><TT>VLAPEAK</TT></A> will need to be set and the user should consult
the documentation on those parameters.  SCHED&nbsp; can be requested to
fill most of the required parameters using the same information used
for the automatic scan insertion discussed below.  See the discussion
of the parameter <A HREF="node145.html#MP:POINT"><TT>POINT</TT></A> for information on
how to control this semi-automatic mode.

<P>
Explicit insertion of pointing scans can be a pain and can completely
dominate the work involved in scheduling high frequency observations.
Therefore SCHED&nbsp; has a mode where it can do the work.  This mode is
invoked with the <A HREF="node54.html#MP:AUTOPEAK"><TT>AUTOPEAK</TT></A> command and
involves the use of a special set of input parameters either from a
separate file, the <A HREF="node139.html#MP:PEAKFILE"><TT>PEAKFILE</TT></A>, or from
in-stream commands, in the main SCHED&nbsp; input, contained between
<A HREF="node140.html#MP:PEAKINIT"><TT>PEAKINIT</TT></A> and <TT>ENDPEAK</TT>.  A standard
version of this file is called <A NAME="tex2html60"
  HREF="catalogs/peak.cmd"><I>peak.cmd</I></A>
and is available in the
SCHED&nbsp; catalogs subdirectory.  That file can be used as an example of
the format.  It is possible to watch details of the process by which
SCHED&nbsp; chooses pointing sources by setting the parameter
<A HREF="node143.html#MP:PKWATCH"><TT>PKWATCH</TT></A>.  Be warned that this can produce
a lot of output to the <I>sched.runlog</I> file.

<P>
There are several examples that demonstrate the use of reference
pointing.  <A NAME="tex2html61"
  HREF="examples/eg3mma.key"><I>eg3mma.key</I></A>
sets up the pointing scans without any help from the automatic
features in SCHED.  <A NAME="tex2html62"
  HREF="examples/eg3mmb.key"><I>eg3mmb.key</I></A>
demonstrates use of the external
peak command file.  <A NAME="tex2html63"
  HREF="examples/eg3mmc.key"><I>eg3mmc.key</I></A>
produces the same results but using
<A HREF="node140.html#MP:PEAKINIT"><TT>PEAKINIT</TT></A> and no external file.
<A NAME="tex2html64"
  HREF="examples/egvla7mm.key"><I>egvla7mm.key</I></A>
shows
the insertion of peaking scans on the VLA. These examples only include
a few VLBA stations and the VLA.  Others will be added to demonstrate
scheduling of more global observations such as those of the CMVA.

<P>
The peaking control information is organized around groups of antennas
and lists of possible pointing sources.  Up to 5 groups of antennas
can be specified.  For full automatic pointing, separate scans will be
added for each group (this can add quite a few scans).  For each
group, SCHED&nbsp; finds the source in the pointing list that can be
reached most quickly from the target source, that is above a specified
minimum elevation at all antennas in the group.  Pointing will only be
added for scans observing at a frequency above a specified cutoff and
only when there is enough of a gap in the schedule to fit one or two
scans plus the slew to the pointing source from the previous VLBI source
and the slew to the next VLBI source.

<P>
The input parameters for the <A HREF="node139.html#MP:PEAKFILE"><TT>PEAKFILE</TT></A> are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>SRCFILE</TT> specifies the file name for a file containing
pointing sources.  That file is in the same format as the
<A HREF="node196.html#SEC:SRCCAT">main source catalog</A> and, indeed, is appended to
the source catalog in the internal files in SCHED.  The default is
<I>$SCHED/catalogs/sources.pointing</I> which is a file provided with
the SCHED&nbsp; distribution.  If you don't wish that any file is read (ie
the pointing sources are in the main source catalog), specify <TT>NONE</TT>.  This parameter can only be specified once, or rather the last
value specified for all groups is used.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>SETUP</TT> specifies the setup file to use for this group for
pointing.  If not specified, it keeps the value set in the previous
group.  The initial default is blank, which will probably produce an error.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>LINEINIT</TT> has exactly the same effect as the main program
input <A HREF="node111.html#MP:LINEINIT"><TT>LINEINIT</TT></A> and is used to delimit
input of spectral line rest frequencies.  This allows the frequencies
to be specified in the <A HREF="node139.html#MP:PEAKFILE"><TT>PEAKFILE</TT></A> rather
than the main program.  It is allowed to have <TT>LINEINIT</TT> sections
in both the main program and the <I>PEAKFILE</I>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>MINFREQ</TT> is the minimum frequency (MHz) for which attempts will
be made to insert pointing scans.  The default is 60000 MHz which is
appropriate for the VLBA.  This parameter keeps the value of the previous
group if not specified.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>MINEL</TT> is the minimum elevation allowed for a pointing scan.
Higher elevation scans will give better results, but to high a <TT>MINEL</TT>
may cause SCHEDto have to choose a pointing source that is far away.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>DWELL</TT> is the minimum integration time to use for a pointing
scan.  For the VLBA, the default of 60 seconds is appropriate.  For the
VLA, it should be longer.  See the discussion of the schedule parameter
<A HREF="node190.html#MP:VLAPEAK"><TT>VLAPEAK</TT></A> for much more information.
<TT>DWELL</TT> keeps the value set for the previous group if not set.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>STATIONS</TT> is used to specify the stations for the group.
As of this writing, the maximum number is 30, which is also the maximum
number of stations in a schedule.  Stations in a group will share a
pointing scan while a separate scan, potentially with a separate
reference source, will be used for stations in another group.  It
is appropriate to keep stations at each end of the array in separate
groups because the appropriate reference source may vary near
the time of rise or set of the target source.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>LINENAME</TT> specifies which sepectral line to use in a reference
pointing scan.  It has the same meaning as the main schedule parameter
<A HREF="node112.html#MP:LINENAME"><TT>LINENAME</TT></A>.  It defaults to blank which is
probably not what you want.  It keep the same value as the previous
group if not set.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>VLAMODE</TT> specifies the main schedule parameter
<A HREF="node189.html#MP:VLAMODE"><TT>VLAMODE</TT></A> to use for the pointing scans
involving the VLA.  See the descriptions of that parameter and of
<A HREF="node190.html#MP:VLAPEAK"><TT>VLAPEAK</TT></A> for details.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>ENDPEAK</TT> is used to terminate peak command input in the
main SCHED&nbsp; control file.  It should be in a group of its own since
no other parameters specified with it will be parsed.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
As with all types of SCHED&nbsp; input, end each group with a ``/''.  The
order of parameters within a group (between ``/''s) is not significant.
