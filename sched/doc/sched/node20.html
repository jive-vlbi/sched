GENERAL CONCERNS
</H3>

<P>
A fact of life with VLBI has been that the data are recorded on tapes
and tapes have various limitations.  Tapes are not infinitely long and
they cannot be stopped and started instantaneously.  Whenever they are
stopped, they must be resynchronized at the correlator, which takes a
few to a few tens of seconds.  Also tapes have finite bandwidth and
capacity.  The instantaneous bandwidth cannot be exceeded.  This
section provides some detail on various aspects of tape management.

<P>
Many of the concerns described here do not apply to the disk based
recording systems (mainly Mark5) that began to be deployed in 2003.
The disk systems can start and stop very quickly and take less time to
be synchronized on the correlators.  There still are limitations on
the total bit rate and recording volume.  But disk management is be
much less visible to the user than tape management.  For the rest of
this section, we are talking about tapes.  Hopefully by late 2005,
this whole section can be relegated to a historical appendix to this
manual.

<P>
The scheduler always has to worry about not exceeding the amount of
tape that has been allocated for the project.  For projects only
including stations that use automatic tape allocation (eg VLBA, VLA,
and GBT), that should be the only concern other than providing
occasional gaps for readback tests, as described later, and not
stopping the tape too often.  Automatic tape handling is described in
more detail below in the section on <A HREF="node27.html#SSSEC:AUTOTAPE">automatic tape
allocation</A> and in the description of the
<A HREF="node55.html#MP:AUTOTAPE"><TT>AUTOTAPE</TT></A> input parameter.  If there are
any stations at which automatic tape handling is not being used, the
scheduler has a lot more to worry about.  Tape reversals, without
automatic tape handling, can only occur at scan boundaries.  For
efficient tape usage, the schedule must have scan breaks at
appropriate intervals given the tape type and recording speed.  More
is said about this below, especially in the section on <A HREF="node22.html#SSSEC:TAPELEN">tape
lengths</A>.

<P>
The schedules sent to the antennas will also have to specify such
details as track assignments, head positions etc unless automatic
tape allocation is used.  The user, however, should not need to
worry about these details since SCHED&nbsp; has defaults that work fine
in all but odd test observations.  For the masochistic, the details
of the SCHED&nbsp; defaults are given in Appendix <A HREF="node311.html#APP:HEAD">A.3</A>.

<P>
The maximum bit rate that can be recorded on a VLBA tape is 256 Mbps.
The systems at the VLBA antennas and at the VLA and Green Bank have
two drives and can use both simultaneously to achieve 512 Mbps.
Mark IV systems can have 2 head stacks on a single drive to achieve
512 Mbps.  In addition, they can record at 16 Mbps per track, twice
the normal maximum rate.  With both heads recording at 16 Mbps per
track, the Mark IV systems can reach 1024 Mbps.

<P>
When part of an project uses the two drive (VLBA) or two head
(Mark IV) mode, all of that project will be recorded in that mode.
If some scans use narrower bandwidth, the tape drives will be slowed.
This avoids lots of confusion in keeping track of tape usage.
