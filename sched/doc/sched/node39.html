VLBI at the VLA
</H2>

<P>
For much detailed information on VLBI at the VLA, follow the links to
the <A NAME="tex2html69"
  HREF="http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/vla/vlbivla/current/html/">VLBI at the VLA guide</A>.

<P>
There are two very different modes in which VLBI can be done at the
VLA.  These are single dish and phased array observations.  For single
dish VLBI observations, the IF signals from one antenna of the array
are sent to the VLBI recording equipment (VLBA DAR and recorder).
Other than having to worry about the VLA's rather complicated LO
system, such observations are very similar to observations at other
VLBI observatories.  The phased array observations, on the other hand,
have some very special needs.  For such observations, the signals from
all VLA antennas are summed in the VLA correlator and the summed
signal is sent to the VLBI equipment.  This gives a sensitivity for
the ``antenna'' that is increased by about the number of phased
antennas, <EM>if</EM> the array is phased properly.  Array phasing is
accomplished by the on-line control system.  Output phases from the
correlator are used to derive adjustments to the phase of the LO at
each antenna that, when applied, will cause the next correlator phases
to go toward zero.  The system can phase up on a calibrator and then
freeze the phases on a target source when the target source is either
too weak, resolved, or confused for successful phasing.

<P>
The type of VLA observation is distinguished by the <A HREF="node189.html#MP:VLAMODE"><TT>VLAMODE</TT></A>.  <TT>VLAMODE = VS</TT> indicates single
dish observing.  <TT>VLAMODE = VX</TT> indicates phased array observing,
but using the phases from a previous phasing scan.
<TT>VLAMODE = VA</TT> indicates phased array observing with phasing
on the VLA <TT>A</TT> and <TT>D</TT> IFs and is the usual active phasing
mode.  <TT>VLAMODE = VB</TT> is similar, but with phasing
on the VLA <TT>B</TT> and <TT>C</TT> IFs.  <TT>VLAMODE = VR</TT> or <TT>VL</TT>
indicates phased array observing using, respectively, the VLA
<TT>A</TT> and <TT>B</TT> or <TT>C</TT> and <TT>D</TT> IFs.  As might be deduced
by this, because of hardware limitations, the VLA can only phase
one of the <TT>A</TT> and <TT>C</TT> IFs and one of the <TT>B</TT> and <TT>D</TT>
IFs.  The <TT>VLAMODE</TT> can be changed on a scan-by-scan basis, although
<TT>VS</TT> mode (single dish) should not be mixed with the phased
array modes.  See the description of the setup parameter
<A HREF="node237.html#SP:IFCHAN"><TT>IFCHAN</TT></A> for more information on routing VLA
IFs to VLB IFs.

<P>
For successful phasing of the array, a source must be greater than
about 0.1 Jy (see the guide referenced above for details) and have a
position that is good to a fraction of the VLA synthesized beam
(enhanced sensitivity is only obtained over this area).  It must have
small structure phases and not have other sources in the primary beam
that might confuse the phasing algorithm.  The position accuracy is
especially important if a calibrator is being used to phase the array
for observations of another source.  Adding phasing sources is tricky,
because it is desirable to spend a minimum amount of time on them, but
if they are missed, the rest of the data will be bad.

<P>
There are two ways to deal with VLBI observations that require
phasing on a source different from the target source.  The best
is probably to simply schedule VLBI scans, with the proper <A HREF="node189.html#MP:VLAMODE"><TT>VLAMODE</TT></A>, on the phasing source.  These observations
can then also be used to assist the VLBI calibration, assuming an
appropriate calibrator has been chosen.  The other scheme is to
insert calibration scans into the VLA's schedule file (the OBSERVE
file), but not the tape control file, for the phasing operation.
SCHED&nbsp; provides some tools to simplify this operation.  It can
also be done using the VLA OBSERVE program.  This is done
by the VLA analysts for some programs, especially Mark&nbsp;III programs.

<P>
For VLBI observations at the VLA, both an OBSERVE file and a VLBA
style tape control file are needed and can be created by SCHED.  All
of the controls provided for managing tapes for the VLBA also work for
the VLA.  SCHED&nbsp; also has special capabilities for scheduling VLA
observations as described below.

<P>
Mark&nbsp;III programs that use the VLA are often scheduled using PC-SCHED (the Haystack program).  The resulting ``Standard Schedule
File Format'' or drg file is sent to the AOC where staff will convert
it to a SCHED&nbsp; keyin file using SKEDCONV.  They will then run
SCHED&nbsp; to create the required files for both the VLA and the VLBA.
For such observations, phasing sources are usually inserted where
required after the initial OBSERVE file has been made.

<P>
For observations that require phasing on a calibrator,
the array must be phased in auto-phasing (<A HREF="node189.html#MP:VLAMODE"><TT>VLAMODE =
VA</TT></A>) mode prior to VLBI observations of the target source in
extended-phasing (<A HREF="node189.html#MP:VLAMODE"><TT>VLAMODE = VX</TT></A>) mode.
These calibrator observations constitute
additional scans that must be in the VLA observe file, but that no
other VLBI observatory or the tape control file for the VLA needs to
know about. (Note that Westerbork needs something of the sort, but
they have never requested special information in SCHED&nbsp; output
files).

<P>
If it is desired to add phasing scans on a calibrator on which VLBI
data will not be recorded and that will not be observed at the other
VLBI observatories, the parameter <A HREF="node192.html#MP:VLAPSRC"><TT>VLAPSRC</TT></A>
can be used.  If a <A HREF="node192.html#MP:VLAPSRC"><TT>VLAPSRC</TT></A> is given,
SCHED&nbsp; will automatically insert phasing observations in the VLA
OBSERVE file at appropriate times.  Note that <A HREF="node192.html#MP:VLAPSRC"><TT>VLAPSRC</TT></A> must be a source in the same catalogs that are
searched for <A HREF="node166.html#MP:SOURCE"><TT>SOURCE</TT></A> and <A HREF="node79.html#MP:DOPSRC"><TT>DOPSRC</TT></A>. SCHED&nbsp; will add a phasing scan to the observe
file which will end either 1 minute before the main VLBI scan starts,
or 3 minutes after the previous VLBI scan ends, whichever is later.
If the latter option is used, SCHED&nbsp; complains if less than 2 minutes
of the VLBI scan remains.  Also with the latter option, the VLBA-style
tape control file will still start the tape when the main VLBI scan
was supposed to start. This keeps tape motions at the VLA and other
sites synchronized, although it can lead to the need to flag data that
won't have VLBI fringes. SCHED&nbsp; will not add a phasing scan if the
VLBI scan is in <A HREF="node189.html#MP:VLAMODE"><TT>VLAMODE=VA</TT></A> or if
<A HREF="node192.html#MP:VLAPSRC"><TT>VLAPSRC</TT></A> is the same as <A HREF="node166.html#MP:SOURCE"><TT>SOURCE</TT></A>. This avoids the need to keep respecifying
<A HREF="node192.html#MP:VLAPSRC"><TT>VLAPSRC</TT></A> whenever a VLBI calibrator is
observed in mode <TT>VA</TT> and prevents the addition of unnecessary
extra scans when the VLBI schedule calls for observations of the
phasing source.

<P>
It is highly recommended that the NRAO OBSERVE program be used
to check the VLA observe file for slew and dwell times on the phasing
sources. The scan stop times may have to be adjusted with OBSERVE to obtain an adequate amount of on-source time for phasing.
It is especially critical to be careful about slew times for sources
near the zenith where long azimuth slews may be needed to go a short
distance on the sky.  SCHED&nbsp; only recently acquired to ability to
calculate slew times and this has not yet been extended to the VLA
phasing scans.  This is an area of future construction.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; is also able to deal with reference pointing using the
<A HREF="node138.html#MP:PEAK"><TT>PEAK</TT></A> command.  Refer to the description
of <TT>PEAK</TT> for details.  The <A HREF="#SSSEC:VLAONLY">VLA-only example</A>
below uses this capability.
