Version 8.0 of SCHED has been released.

This release contains many mostly minor updates made over the more
than two years since the last release.  In the interest of getting it
out to users, it does not contain all the new features that we hope to
add before long so expect additional updates in the next few months.

For details, see the release notes in the manual
(http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html).
Some sample items in the release are:

SCHED is now under revision control with SVN.

Many changes in code and documentation reflect the switch from
tape to disk.

Changes to support the EVLA have started to appear including the
ability to set frequencies outside the old VLA bands, the ability to
mix phased array and single observations, the ability to specify the
correlator integration time, the ability to specify the reference
antenna (you shouldn't need this), and freq.dat entries for 5cm
methanol and OH lines.  Some unused features were removed.  There
will be much more in this area as the project progresses.

Examples for HSA observations have been added.

A 24GHz band was added for observations at 23.8 GHz  - away from 
the atmospheric water line.  At least on the VLBA where the receivers
were upgraded recently, this can be noticably more sensitive than
the usual 22.2 GHz default (which is still available).

It is now the default to produce VEX output files.  This is in
preparation for their use on the VLBA software correlator.  A few
types of observations are not supported in the SCHED VEX code and, for
them, DOVEX=-1 must be specified to turn off the VEX output.  These
mostly involve observations of moving objects like satellites.

The station and source catalogs are now based on the 2008a_astro
solution from GSFC.

SCHED is now distributed in a single gzipped tar file containing all
code, examples, catalogs, and executable binaries.  Given the sizes of
downloads required for updates typical in the computer world today, it
was no longer considered useful to have multiple small files.  The tar
file contains binaries for several architectures, one of which might
just work for you.  If not, there is also a new scheme with scripts
that edit a master makefile to use to rebuild SCHED.  Note that there
are transitions going on between 32 and 64 bit machines, between g77
and gfortran compilers in the GNU world, and between PPC and Intel
chips on the Mac side, so there is a proliferation of binaries that
might be needed.  We have not tried to provide an exhaustive set.
