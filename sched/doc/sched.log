          Entering LaTeX 2.09 COMPATIBILITY MODE
 *************************************************************
    !!WARNING!!    !!WARNING!!    !!WARNING!!    !!WARNING!!   
 
 This mode attempts to provide an emulation of the LaTeX 2.09
 author environment so that OLD documents can be successfully
 processed. It should NOT be used for NEW documents!
 
 New documents should use Standard LaTeX conventions and start
 with the \documentclass command.
 
 Compatibility mode is UNLIKELY TO WORK with LaTeX 2.09 style
 files that change any internal macros, especially not with
 those that change the FONT SELECTION or OUTPUT ROUTINES.
 
 Therefore such style files MUST BE UPDATED to use
          Current Standard LaTeX: LaTeX2e.
 If you suspect that you may be using such a style file, which
 is probably very, very old by now, then you should attempt to
 get it updated by sending a copy of this error message to the
 author of that file.
