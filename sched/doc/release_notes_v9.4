SCHED version 9.4 is now available as of January 24, 2011.  In
Socorro, it is the standard version in /usr/local.  The
tar files with the code and the binary executables can be found at
ftp.aoc.nrao.edu in pub/sched (and the binaries subdirectory).  There
was a developer and New Mexico local release last week.  There is
one small change of case in the Vex files in the Jan. 24 version.

Major features in this release are listed below.  Some have been
available to the community through the beta releases, but all are new
since 9.3.  A more complete listing can be found in the release notes
which are included at the back of the manual available at
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html
(http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html after this version
is made standard).

1.  Prevent excessively long comments in Vex files that were causing
problems at the stations.  Actually they are wrapped so nothing is
lost, but the maximum line length of VEX is not exceeded.

2.  Install more realistic slew rates for the VLBA antennas.  These
were overestimated by the nominal rate, causing some loss of data
after long slews with DWELL scheduling.  The new rates may need
another update soon as this triggered some work on the control system,
but they should now be conservative.

3.  Support the ability of the DiFX correlator to use multiple phase
centers (up to hundreds) in one pass.  The coordinates of all the
phase centers can be provided to SCHED and passed through the new .v2d
file to the correlator.  There is a new section in the manual
describing this capability.

4.  Give CORCHAN a second argument to hold the FFT size.

5.  Add the capability to automatically generate geodetic segments for
atmospheric calibration.  These are the segments used by the AIPS task
DELZN.  Automatic generation allows the overall schedule to be time
shifted for dynamic scheduling so will be preferred for VLBA
observations.  It also can generate an optimized schedule for whatever
antennas are present, not just VLBA antennas.  Such segments can be
used with very short scans for a pseudo tipping scan (someday SCHED
should learn how to do tipping scans) to get atmospheric opacity.  The
scheme for requesting these segments, and a description of the
algorithm is included in a special section in the manual.

6.  Support observations with the new wide bandwidth hardware for the
VLBA and other systems - the RDBE digital backend and the Mark5C
recording system.  This will also simplify support for the DBBC,
although that is not explicitly there yet.  The support is not yet
complete in the sense that SCHED does not use the BAND mechanism to
set all the frequencies, but the amount of setup information required
is not large.  SCHED does check that setup parameters are reasonable.
Both the PFB and the not-yet-deployed DDC personalities of the RDBE
are supported, although some tweaks to the DDC support will be
required eventually.  The new hardware is controlled at the VLBA
stations by a new control program on a new computer.  That system gets
schedule information from the VEX file.  The old control system is
also present and will be required for control of old hardware including
receivers and the antenna.  The crd files from SCHED are still used for
that.  The VLBA DAR and Mark5A are also still present and can be used
in special cases in parallel with the Mark5C.  There are new examples
egrdbe.key and egddc.key showing how to use the wideband equipment.
The "Wide Band Observing: RDBE, DBBC, VLBA, and Mark IV Modes"
section of the manual covers this capability.

7.  Most of the tape support, including many subroutines, has been 
removed from SCHED.  Tapes are history everywhere as far as we were
able to learn.

8.  The number of allowed aliases for source names was increased from
5 to 10.  Yes, there are sources that needed more than 5.

9.  Optional second and third arguments were added to the DWELL
parameter.  The second is an integer indicating that the scan can
start while that many antennas are still slewing.  This is to help
avoid having most of the array sitting on source doing nothing while a
slow antenna, or an antenna near the zenith where long azimuth slews
are needed to go short distances, is getting to source.  If an antenna
cannot get to source, it is removed from the scan.  But some effort is
made to prevent the antenna from getting stuck on one source during a
phase referencing operation when it would be better to lose a couple
of cases and do the slew (wrap or zenith passage usually).  The third
argument is a minimum dwell time for the slow antennas.  That can be
used to insure that all antennas get some on-source time even if the
scan has to be extended past the requested duration for those antennas
that got there quickly.

10.  The scan timing calculations, especially for long slews and wraps,
were tweaked to try to be more accurate.  It turns out, for long slews
on slow antennas, it actually matters that the Earth rotates during 
the slew.

11.  The location and source catalogs were updated to the latest from
Goddard and from Leonid Petrov.  There are now 5777 sources in the
source catalog, most with astrometric (few milli-arcsecond or better)
positions.  There are still a few hundred residual VLA calibrator list
and JVAS sources whose positions aren't as good.  For sources.vlba,
the positions from GSFC gsf2010a_astro solution were used where
available.  Additional sources in Petorv's RFC_2010C solution were
added.  Then any sources from the old sources.vlba that were not
replaced by the new data were kept, although sources from Petrov's
2009 catalog that did not appear in the 2010 catalog were assumed to
be bad and discarded.  The other sources that were retained were the
VLA and JVAS sources mostly.  The locations file was updated with 
station positions from the gsf2010a_astro solution.  Note that now 
the station and source positions in the VEX files from SCHED are used
in corration, at least on the VLBA, so they need to be good.

12.  Add flux densities for the large majority of the sources in the
source catalog.  Many thanks to Leonid Petrov for providing his
geodetic catalog with this information attached.  SCHED now has access
to the flux information, but does not do anything with it yet.  This
does provide a major step toward eventual automatic selection of
calibrators.

13.  The MINPAUSE parameter, which prevents short stoppages of the
recording media, is no longer multiplied by the "speedup factor".
The speedup factor has become somewhat meaningless with the new 
correlators and recording systems.

14.  Remove much of the effort to keep the same format (fan out) 
at different stations and to avoid changes in the "track" bit rate
with time.  This allows each station and each scan to use whatever 
is a reasonable data format.  This simplifies the logic in SCHED that
used to have to be aware of what was needed for all scans/stations
before it could start picking formats.


With this many changes, please be alert to possible problems.  The
43 examples are all run as part of testing so the program gets shaken
out pretty well, but there's nothing like actual use to find hidden
problems.

Cheers,

Craig Walker
