<H2>Hewlett-Packard HPGL Plotters</H2>

HPGL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language) is a vector-graphics format
for control of pen-plotters and laser-printers manufactured by
Hewlett-Packard Co., and some other manufacturers. This PGPLOT device
handler produces files that should be acceptable to most HPGL and
HPGL/2 devices, specifically the HP7475A Plotter.

<DL>
<DT>Device type code <DD><CODE>/HPGL</CODE> (landscape orientation),
<CODE>/VHPGL</CODE> (portrait orientation).

<DT>Default file name
<DD><CODE>pgplot.hpgl</CODE><BR>

<DT>Default view surface dimensions
<DD>/HPGL: 16640 by 11040 pixels (16.38 by 10.87 inches)<BR>
    /VHPGL: 110400 by 16640 pixels (nominally 10.87 by 16.38 inches)<BR>
    These dimensions are chosen for 17 by 11-inch paper.

<DT>Resolution
<DD>The nominal resolution is 1016 pixels/inch, but
the actual resolution will vary depending on the display device.

<DT>Color capability
<DD>Color indices 1--6 are accepted, and are interpreted as pen numbers.

<DT>Input capability
<DD>None.

<DT>Environment variables
<DD>If environment variable <CODE>PGPLOT_GL_TERMINAL</CODE> has value
YES (or any string beginning with Y or y), it is assumed that the
output device is a plotter connected <EM>before</EM> the terminal using the
Y-cable (HP part #17455A), in which case the plotter is ``turned on''
and xon/xoff handshaking is enabled using escape sequences.
Otherwise, it is the user's responsibility to add control codes, if
needed.  If there is more than one plot and the plot is on a terminal,
a prompt will be generated, allowing the page to be advanced.

<DT>File format
<DD>HPGL files are plain text.
