MAKESTA is a very slight variation of MAKESETUP.

The only changes are to the include file and getdat.f.
The dimensions of the arrays are switched from being
oriented to many small output files to one very large
one.  In getdat, the input file is renamed to something
appropriate for the stations catalog.  The code
in code/makesetup should be considered to be the
master and any real changes should be made there.
