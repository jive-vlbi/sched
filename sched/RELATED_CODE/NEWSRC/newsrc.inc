C     The old catalog, which becomes the new catalog as sources are
C     adjusted or added.

C     Parameter MAL, then maximum number of aliases, is from rdcat.inc.

C
C     The input catalog.  Originally, each source was processed and
C     added or used to adjust the old catalog.  But it was found that
C     there are issues like sources with the same name so it is useful
C     to have the catalog.

C     Program variables.
C     NSRC is the number of sources in the old input catalog, and then
C     for the full catalog as the old catalog is enhanced by sources 
C     from the new catalog.
C     NCAT is the number of sources in the new input catalog.
C     USRREMRK is shorter than REMARK to allow room to add 
C     number of observations for some formats.
