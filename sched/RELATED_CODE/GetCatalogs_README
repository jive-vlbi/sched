The routines and data for constructing the SCHED source and locations
catalogs are at /home/noatak/cwalker/code/Calibration/GetCatalogs.


The program NEWSRC has become sophisticated enough to warrent its own
area here in $SCHED/RELATED_CODE.  Compilation does require my
libraries which is something to address eventually.  Most, but not
all, of the routines used from the libraries are in $SCHED/src/Cit.

The libraries are maintained in subdirectories in svn under 
 https://svn.aoc.nrao.edu/repos/VLBA/rcwlib/trunk

NEWLOC has also been given an area here.

NEWSRC is for constructing new source catalogs from the GSFC and Petrov 
       solutions.
NEWLOC is for construction new locations.dat from the GSFC solution.
