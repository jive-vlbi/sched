CR:
---------------------------------------
v79
030303 vxnmfq: added new $FREQ name for freq (SUMILO) > 1e5

030303 vxnmif: added new $IF name for freq (SUMILO) > 1e5

030304 vxs2md: changed call to vxs2vl to use NETSIDE instead of SIDEBD for
           checking validity (bug triggered by stations with low pass FIRSTLO).

030521 vxwrmd: don't write headpos/passorder for disk only stations 
      
030902 vxcftr, vxwrtr: make sure that disk stations get different track modes
to the tape stations so that vxwrmd works properly.

030909 vxwrt: do not allow disks to be used for VEX files until DRUDG has been
upgraded or unless VEXTEST is specified.

---------------------------------------
v80
030929 vxcfhp: add check for disks
       vxwrhp: Don't write headpos def for disks
       vxcfpo: add check for disks
       vxwrpo: Don't write passorder def for disks

031103 chk4dar: check that either 1N or 2N are specified for MkIV racks.

040107 chk4dar: improved error messages with 'messages.txt'

---------------------------------------
v81
040920 chk4rec: changed tape speed error to be more informative
040920 chkjive: changed seterr to errset, and changed the barrel-roll message
040927 chk4rec: removed barrel-rolling warnings
040927 chkv4rec: removed barrel-rolling warnings
040927 vxwrrl: new barrel-rolling warnings
041004 wlog.f: the format is wrong when TERM .ne. 0/1 - alert Craig
041007 vxtramd.f: fixed a *really* nasty bug that occurred when adding new
        modes iff the phase cal tones were off - indexing was wrong in copying
        the old mode to the new mode
041007 vxnmph.f: make setups that have pcal=off use the 'NoDetect' name
041019 vxvlbs.f, vxmode.f, *.f: vxvlbs.f is a new routine to test the VLBA
        stations to see if they are all doing the same thing. Any that are not
        get noted in 'VLBASSTA' and 'VLBASSET' which we can be tested whenever
        we are doing a station comparison. This test has been added throughout
        the VEX code. 
041025 chkjive: prohibit oversampling greater than 4 coming to jive
041025 vxsch.f, vxtran.f: added ftp and evlbi scans
---------------------------------------
v85 050801
vxwrda: make adaptive motion default for disks - can remove with VEXTEST
vxsch: fixed bug in writing the Gbytes for stations that skipped scans

---------------------------------------
v86 050801
vxvlbs.f, vxcf*.f: removed vxvlbs, as VLBAs now get one setup file per station
        like everyone else. Setup comparators also changed because VLBA no
        longer a special case.
vxscns.f, vxsort.f, vxstli.f, vxtone.f, vxwrda.f, vxwrmd.f, vxwrpr.f, vxsch.f: 
        This was a biggy. Allow use of modes with FORMAT=NONE (see eg3mmb.key).
        Add checks in various places to make sure that these modes are skipped
        and in the SCHED section replace the mode of the FORMAT=NONE scans with
        the format of a recording scan. This was a fairly big overhaul and I
        hope I haven't broken anything.
vxgtst.f: simple function to return the SCHED Setup from which a VEX Mode was
        derived
vxscns.f: fixed bug where VXMDIFP was not set properly for all stations in scan
        (see GB057)
v86 051110
vxsch, vxschk.f: added more rigorous testing for frequency of Tsys
        measurements. Discourage long continuous motion with disks because of
        need to bank switch.
v86 051114
vxscns.f: fixed bug which meant that spurious new modes were being created
        (reported in c052a).
v86 060203
vxsch.f: minor changes to messages

--------------------------
v87 071102
chk4dar.f: added geodetic patching
vxsch.f: allow an extra digit in the GB section of the schedule.
vxwrt.f: remove warning about using disks.
v87 071217
vxschk.f, vxsch.f: changed check on continuous recording so it depends on the
      number of bytes recorded, not just the time. Changed text of warning.
---------------------------
v148 081120
vxwrsi.f: added "site_velocity", "site_position_epoch"
vxwrex.f: added "exper_nominal_start", "exper_nominal_end"
---------------------------
v154 081212
vxsudt.f: Corrected the calculation of RARATE and DECRATE to be 'per year'
          by multiplying the values of DRA DDEC (arc-sec per DAY) by 365.25
          not dividing by 365.25 (corrected by D. Graham)
