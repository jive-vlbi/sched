There are several makefiles provided that are set up for
various architectures.  There is likely to be one ready to
go for whatever system a user has.

Having several files, there is a risk of divergence.  Therefore
Makefile.linux will be considered the fundamental one from which
others are derived.  Changes made in others should be fed back
into that one, at least as comments.  Any of the others may be
incomplete in terms of offered options.

Someday something better should be set up, like a configure script.
If you know how to do that and can volunteer some help, it would
be appreciated.

Note that making Makefile a link, and specifying something like
make -f Makefile.linux both have shown unexpected behavior and not
worked properly.  So a user should take the appropriate specific
Makefile.xxxx and copy it to Makefile before building SCHED.  The
scripts such as MakeLinux combine this action with running make.

Makefile          - The one used by make, but a temporary copy or
                    of, or symbolic link to one of the others.
Makefile.intel    - Use with the Intel compiler on Linux
Makefile.linux    - Use with the GNU compiler on Linux
                       The is the fundamental version.
Makefile.linux.ubuntu - A version that works in Ubuntu Hardy.
Makefile.linux.spice  - Activates the spacecraft tracking capability
Makefile.MacOSX.g77   - For use on MacOSX with g77.
Makefile.MacOSX.gfortran   - For use on MacOSX with gfortran.
Makefile.sun      - For use on Solaris.
