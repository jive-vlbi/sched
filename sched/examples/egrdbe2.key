!  Example of a control file using the new RDBE and MARK5C
!  wideband digital backend and recorder.  This is a rather
!  simpler example than egrdbe.key (which has been removed).  
!  But it still exercises one complexity - it uses Green 
!  Bank at a band where there needs to be sideband inversion 
!  at the correlator (IFs inverted).  It also sets FREQ on 
!  a scan, which can trigger trouble in the VEX code so this 
!  tests that capability.
!
!  Note that the sideband inversion scheme is thought to work
!  on the DiFX correlator, but has not been verified as of 
!  Feb. 2012.  EDIT: Dec 2012.  Now known to work.
!
!  As a demo, this example uses relatively simple setup files.
!
!  Jan 2012.  Add some scans with a setup file that tries to
!  put all 16 RDBE channels in the same polarization, with one
!  starting down from 1040 MHz.  That is the "0" channel in the
!  RDBE.  Either that one, or the one at 528 that goes below 
!  512, is required to have 16 output channels as the PFB wants.

! =======================  Setup files  ====================
! ==========================================================
!  RDBE  Setups using the PFB personality.
!  The bbsyn values must be N*32 + 16 for N between 17 and 32
!  The N=32 option will give corrupted data, but is needed if it is
!  desired to put all 16 channels in one polarization as in the
!  second example setup.
!
!  Note that bbsyn = abs( freqref + freqoff - firstlo ) and is 
!  the frequency within the IF of the DC edge of the output baseband
!  channel.  The firstlo value is normally picked up from the 
!  frequency file.  Here freqref has been set to equal the firstlo 
!  so that freqoff is the frequency in the IF - same as bbsyn.
!
!  For reference, the allowed values of bbsyn (or freqoff here) are:
!  bbsyn = 528.0, 560.0, 592.0,  624.0, 656.0, 688.0, 720.0,  752.0,
!          784.0, 816.0, 848.0,  880.0, 912.0, 944.0, 976.0, 1008.0
!
!  In the first example setup, 5MHz pcal is used as it makes a bit
!  more sense with these bandwidths.  But it does mean that the tones
!  (derived from 5 pulses per microsecond rather than 1) add more
!  to the system noise.  The second setup takes the default 1 MHz 
!  and is probably better for science, as opposed to test, observations.
