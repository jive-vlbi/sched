    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:   6.02  May 2005

The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog

Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

         Only  107.02 of  128.00 MHz total bandwidth is within the IFs
         in the setup file before any FREQ or DOPPLER shifts.
TWOHDSET: Using 2 head (MkIV) or 2 tape (VLBA) wide band mode.
SCHOPT:  First output scan will be number     1
SCHOPT:  There will be    72 output scans (    1 -    72) from  42/20:00:00 to  43/01:00:00
