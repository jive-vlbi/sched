DERIVED INFORMATION FOR CORRELATION: 

  Elapsed time for project:         19.01 hours.
  Total time in scheduled scans:    19.67 hours.
  Total time in recording scans:    19.67 hours.
  Total number of baseline hours:  445.45    (Recording scans only)
  Projected maximum data output rate from the correlator:    67.6 kbytes/sec
               if processed in one pass.
  Projected correlator output data set size:   1642.1 Mbytes
    NOTE:  Above numbers assume the same correlator parameters are used for all data.

 **** WARNING *****
      Overlapping scans were detected.  Either there was subarraying
      or some stations were scheduled separtely from others.
      If the latter, the output data rates and volume are underestimated
      because the number of baselines was underestimated.

Notes on the station summaries: 

    "Sync Hours" is on-source, in-scan time lost during correlation to resyncing
    recordings.  Resyncs follow tape stoppages and formatter reconfigures.

    For VLBA stations, total reconfigures and reconfigures during recording are shown.
    Reconfigures during recording can cause slow correlator sync.
    Any reconfigure can slow sync at JIVE.

 ESTIMATED TAPE TIMES (With autoallocation):
        Times are approximate and assume project starts at the beginning of a tape.
        Times can be affected by actual tape length.
        Tape change may occur during scan preceeding indicated time.

            Tape start time.            Tape end time.

  The solar corona can cause unstable phases for sources too close to the Sun.
  SCHED provides warnings at individual scans for distances less than 10 degrees.
  The distance from the Sun to each source in this schedule is:
    Source         Sun distance (deg) 
   W3OH                50.5
   0212+735            57.2
   3C84                34.6
   0552+398            16.7
   1928+738            81.1

  Barry Clark estimates from predictions by Ketan Desai of IPM scattering sizes 
  that the Sun will cause amplitude reductions on the  longest VLBA baselines 
  at a solar distance of 60deg F^(-0.6) where F is in GHz. 
  For common VLBI bands, this is: 
       327 MHz        117. deg 
       610 MHz         81. deg 
       1.6 GHz         45. deg 
       2.3 GHz         36. deg 
       5.0 GHz         23. deg 
       8.4 GHz         17. deg 
      15.0 GHz         12. deg 
      22.0 GHz          9. deg 
      43.0 GHz          6. deg
