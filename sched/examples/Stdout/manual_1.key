!  BE001 example of 3C84 observations at 6 and 4 cm.
!
!    This example shows many things in gory detail and has
!    many comments.  The example manual_2.key is the exact
!    same schedule, but takes advantage of SCHED defaults
!    and is missing most comments.  It looks much less 
!    intimidating and is closer to what users will make.

!  The second setup defaults more parameters than the first and 
!  shows all that a user is really required to provide if the desired
!  frequency is included in the frequency catalog.

!  different rchan and lchan.  To avoid errors, do not use a

! ========================  The Scans  =====================
! ==========================================================
 !  Note that this is a moderately complex schedule, but 
 !  serves to show a number of points about scheduling style.

 !  The scans will be blocked in groups with 11 minutes of record 
 !  time which is 1/4 of a pass on a thin tape at high density.
 !  This is good proceedure when not using automatic tape allocation.
 !  With auto allocation, it can be better to just ignore the 
 !  pass length.

 !  Start with a fringe finder on all antennas at both frequencies.
 !  The dwell time on the second scan tells SCHED to insert enough
 !  of a gap between the scans for the antennas to get to the source.
 !  The VLA will be in single dish mode 'VS' for the whole project.

 !  Now observe the target source, 3C84, along with a short scan on a 
 !  nearby source for use as a position reference at 4 cm.
 !  Each 13+ minute group includes 13 minutes recording, 2 minute gap,
 !  and a few tens of seconds for slews.
 !  The 2 minute gap at the start allows time for readback tests.
 !  Leave out VLBA_MK for 3 hours because the source is not up.
