!  jvla.key
!
!  This is a file to schedule a VLBI observation on the VLA
!  and VLBA.  It uses the WIDER correlator to provide phased
!  array output on the VLA.  It is adapted from jvla.key to
!  use the DDC personality on the VLBA so that a full 512 MHz
!  (2 Gbps) of matched bandwidth is obtained.

! ==================== Setup Information ===================
! ==========================================================
!  This setup uses the RDBE with the DDC personality on the VLBA
!  with 4 by 128 MHz channels.  The baseband sideband at the VLA
!  must be upper.  As with jvla.key, this is for 6 cm near the
!  the old 4990 MHz standard frequency.

!  Use the upper 2 128 MHz possible bands.  The crossover frequencies
!  at  640 and 896 provide some strong constraints - the bands should not
!  cross those frequencies.  Put in a small frequency offset to 
!  help the phase cal.  That will cause a small amount of the band to
!  go outside the crossover.  Make sure that is at the opposite end from
!  the LO.  Trust the VLA to get it exact with it's more finely tunable
!  FIRSTLO's, which don't actually get set to the values SCHED uses.
