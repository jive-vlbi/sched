!  BE001 example of 3C84 observations at 6 and 4 cm.
!
!    This example shows many things in gory detail and has
!    many comments.  The example manual_2.key is the exact
!    same schedule, but takes advantage of SCHED defaults
!    and is missing most comments.  It looks much less 
!    intimidating and is closer to what users will actually 
!    make.

! ==========================================================
!  For this example, to show the format, get 2 stations from the 
!  internal station catalog.  Get the rest from the standard catalog.
!  Note that any stations here must have their positions here and
!  not depend on the locations file.  Normally accurate positions 
!  would be in XYZ, but for a new station, or for configuration
!  searches, Elev/Long/Lat might be more convenient.

!  Now specify the setup information.  These are nearly copies of 
!  two older standard setups.  Both set up 4 channel recordings in 
!  vlba mode with 1:4 fan out and 64 Mbits per second.  The channel
!  bandwidths are 8 MHz and the sampling is with 1 bit per sample.
!  The first is for frequencies in the 6 cm band.  The second is 4 cm.
!  The second setup defaults more parameters than the first and 
!  shows all that a user is really required to provide if the desired
!  frequency is included in the frequency catalog.

!  Note, here is where VLA1 and VLA27 are different - they have
!  different rchan and lchan.  To avoid errors, do not use a 
!  generic "VLA".  The switch to the WIDAR correlator will cause
!  most VLA information to change in the future.

! ==========================================================
 !  Note that this is a moderately complex schedule, but 
 !  serves to show a number of points about scheduling style.

 !  Start with a fringe finder on all antennas at both frequencies.
 !  The dwell time on the second scan tells SCHED to insert enough
 !  of a gap between the scans for the antennas to get to the source.
 !  The VLA will be in single dish mode 'VS' for the whole project.

 !  Now observe the target source, 3C84, along with a short scan on a 
 !  nearby source for use as a position reference at 4 cm.
 !  Each 13+ minute group includes 13 minutes recording, 2 minute gap,
 !  and a few tens of seconds for slews.
 !  The 2 minute gap at the start allows time for readback tests.
 !  Leave out VLBA_MK for 3 hours because the source is not up.

 !  with dwell scheduling is demonstrated
