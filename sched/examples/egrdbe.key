!  Example of a rather complicated control file using the 
!  new RDBE and MARK5C wideband digital backend and recorder.
!
!  The version of the RDBE PFB firmware available at the time 
!  had a fixed arrangement of basebands.  Two 512 MHz wide
!  IFs (opposite polarizations) between 512 and 1024 MHz are
!  polyphase filtered into 16 X 32MHz subbands (basebands) 
!  each.  Every other one of those is quantized again to 2 
!  bit samples and recorded, for a total 2 Gbps recording 
!  rate.  That is the arrangement specified in the setups
!  here.  It is now possible to pick any desired 32 MHz
!  MHz subband, although the subbands are fixed in the
!  512-1024 MHz IF at frequencies of N*32 + 16 MHz for N
!  between 16 and 32 (the one at 1040 will be corrupted, but
!  is allowed so that all 16 required subbands can be in the 
!  same polarization).
!
!  For the test, and for many "piggyback" observing runs, 
!  the old VLBA DAR and Mark5A recorder were run in
!  parallel with the RDBE/MARK5C system.  For that situation,
!  SCHED must be run twice.  One pass produces the control
!  files for the old system and for correlation of the data
!  from that system.  The second pass produces the 
!  control file for the new system and for correlation of the
!  data from the new system.  SCHED does not have the 
!  ability to produce all the files at once because many 
!  variables that are reused need different values.
!
!  Setup files are here for both VLBA/Mark5A recordings and 
!  RDBE/Mark5C recordings.  Some show nearly all parameters
!  specified.  Some show the use of SCHED's defaulting
!  capabilities.
!  
!  For the two passes for different systems, not all of the 
!  inputs are the same.  Where there are differences, the lines
!  start with "!MARK5A" or "!MARK5C".  The "!" makes the line
!  a comment so it is ignored by SCHED.  Those identifiers
!  are followed by the active line required for that system.
!  To activate one or the other, remove the "!MARK5A" or 
!  "!MARK5C" from the start of the lines where it appears, 
!  thus activating that line.  A script is available to 
!  do that automatically (using sed).  
!
!  Typically, at the DSOC (AOC), there will be two subdirectories
!  for a piggyback observation, one for the MARK5A and one for the
!  MARK5C files.  The key  file will be kept in the base directory 
!  for the observation.  A script called runsch will be run to
!  create each type of file.  Here in the examples directory is a 
!  copy of the very-simple runsch file and an egrdbe.run file that
!  holds what would normally be typed.
!
!  The example is based on the RDBE fringe test of Dec 3 2010
!  with 5 stations:  LA, PT, HN, MK, BR
!

!  #! /bin/csh
!  # Shortcut for runsch for this directory.
!  ~cwalker/bin/runsch ../td009a.key MARK5C

!  where runsch is:

!  #! /bin/csh
!  /bin/rm temp.key
!  /bin/cp $1 .
!  echo Running $1:t with \!$2 replaced by blanks.
!  echo Modified key file is in temp.key
!  sed   's:\!'$2'::'  <$1:t >temp.key
!  sched < temp.key
