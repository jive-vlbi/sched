!   Note that the scan lengths of 6:30 (390 sec) are more appropriate

!   pass on thin tape.  At the current high density default, about
!   2000 ft of tape will not be used except at the automatic allocation
!   stations.  This shows an effect of the autoreverse ability.

!   
!       Note that both channels will be set to the same frequency
!       so the line will be in both.  To separate, the user would
!       need to specify different rest frequencies for each channel
!       or different velocity for each channel in the source catalog.
!
!       There is some problem with the modes sorting that requires
!       that a more complete setup file be used for the second
!       band.  Huib will work on it.  This should not affect single

!  This file must have evolved.  As of Feb. 4, 2013, this start 
!  is before the end of the above scans so they do overlap.  But
!  SCHED is not objecting because there are no stations in common.
!  It is not the case here, but one should not schedule different
!  stations in different scans on the same source and expect that
!  they will be correlated, as they would have been with the

!  VEX scans and so will not be correlated by a VEX driven correlator
