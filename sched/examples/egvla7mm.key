!  Example of a VLA schedule for observations at 7mm (Q band).
!  This is for VLA observations, not for VLBI.

!  This demonstrates both explicit and automatic insertion of
!  reference pointing scans.

!  Recall that reference pointing on the VLA is done in 
!  interferometer mode so it cannot be used for single dish
!  VLBI at the VLA observations.

!  Write over old output files.  Do not make VEX
