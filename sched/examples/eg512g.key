!   Example schedule for VLBA and Mark IV observations
!   with 512 Mbps recorded bit rate.  This uses 2 tape

!
!   Created originally for testing purposes: H.J. van Langevelde
!   Adapted as a SCHED example: R.C. Walker  28 Dec 2000.
!
!   For testing purposes, there are a couple of lines that 
!   can be swapped to trigger postpass related warnings: look for 
!   !go_warn or !go_ok

!  even though it won't get there.  But this will cause the antenna 
!  to end up on the other wrap and be better for subsequent scans.
