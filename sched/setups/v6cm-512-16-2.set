! Standard setup file: v6cm-512-16-2.set                       
!     (Produced by MAKESETUP)
!      For the 6 cm band.
!        Radio Astronomy allocation: 4990-5000
!        Radio Astnomomy footnote:   4950-4990
!      Reference frequency is Mark II network standard
!      Merlin 4986-5002
!      There is a problem for the DDC with crossovers for the VLBA.
!        Firstlo   BBC for 4990  crossover
!         4100       890           896   6MHz below crossover in RF
!         4400       590           640   Alias issue < 5050
!         5600       610           640   30 MHz above crossover in RF
!         5900       910           896   14 MHz below crossover in RF
!      5600 is probably best, but need to keep frequency low, or
!      span the crossover.  Put this in mode 6cmlo.

!   512 Mbpsf
!   This mode has too many channels for the RDBE_DDC.
!   SCHED will default to the PFB, but then the frequencies
!   and bandwidths will be wrong.
!   It might be useful for other systems.
