!      For the 1 cm band.
!        Radio Astronomy allocation: 22210-22500
!      Reference frequency is Mark II network standard

!   512 Mbpsf
!   This mode has too many channels for the RDBE_DDC.
!   SCHED will default to the PFB, but then the frequencies
!   and bandwidths will be wrong.
!   It might be useful for other systems.
