This directory contains a few subroutine libraries that have been
imported to SCHED but which are not recreated by the makefile.

The libraries included are:

The LINUX NAIF libraries for 32 and 64 bit Linux machines compiled
with g77.  I have not yet tried to make a gfortran version.  The code
and tools for recreating these libraries are in the
$SCHED/RELATED_CODE/NAIF directory.  That directory is not maintained
with svn nor, for reasons of bulk, is it included with SCHED
distributions.

The PGPLOT libraries are also here for some architectures and
compilers.  The OSX version uses gfortran.  The Linux ones without a
compiler name in the directory name are g77.  Where gfortran is used,
that is in the directory name.  Note that the code tools needed to
rebuild these libraries are in the $SCHED/PGPLOT directory structure.
