C     by PERCY.  Be sure to read any notes before adjusting these
C
C
C     The maximum number of commands that can be buffered is
C     determined by the value of MAXCOM.  This parameter is
C     used primarily by NXTCOM.
C
      INTEGER               MAXCOM
      PARAMETER           ( MAXCOM = 20 )
 
 
C
C     The parameter FILEN is the maximum length of a file name
C     on a particular system.
C
      INTEGER               FILEN
      PARAMETER           ( FILEN = 128 )
 
C
C     The parameter COMSIZ is the maximum length allowed for a
C     command.
C
      INTEGER               COMSIZ
      PARAMETER           ( COMSIZ = 1024 )
 
C
C     The parameter ERRSIZ is the maximum length allowed for
C     error messages.
C
      INTEGER               ERRSIZ
      PARAMETER           ( ERRSIZ = 1760 )
C
C     The parameter STYSIZ is the maximum length expected for
C     a NICEPR style string.
C
      INTEGER               STYSIZ
      PARAMETER           ( STYSIZ = 120 )
