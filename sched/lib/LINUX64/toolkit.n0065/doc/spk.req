Abstract
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The SPK system is the component of SPICE concerned with ephemeris data.
 
 
Purpose
 
   The purpose of this document is to describe the SPICE Toolkit software
   provided in the software library SPICELIB, (SPICE LIBrary) used for
   producing and accessing SPICE ephemeris data. In addition this document
   describes SPK---the common file format for NAIF's S-kernel and ephemeris
   portion of the P-kernel.
 
 
Intended Audience
 
   This document is intended for all users of SPK (ephemeris) kernel files.

DAF Run-Time Binary File Format Translation
 
   Starting with the N0052 release of the SPICE Toolkit (January, 2002)
   certain supported platforms are able to read DAF-based binary files
   (SPK, CK and binary PCK) that were written using a different, or
   non-native, binary representation. This access is read-only; any
   operations requiring writing to the file (adding information to the
   comment area, or appending additional ephemeris data, for example)
   require prior conversion of the file to the native binary file format.
   See the Convert User's Guide, convert.ug, for details.
 
 
Detection of Non-native Text Files
 
   Starting with the N0057 release of the SPICE Toolkit (March, 2004) the
   SPICE data loading mechanism detects and prohibits loading text kernel
   files containing lines terminated with EOF character(s) non-native to
   the platform on which the Toolkit was compiled. If a non-native EOL
   terminator is detected in the first 132 characters of a text kernel, the
   execution is stopped and an error message is displayed. This feature
   does not work with files that are smaller that 132 bytes or have the
   first line longer that 132 characters.

Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   To help fully understand the science data returned from a spacecraft's
   instruments it is necessary to know, at any given epoch, the positions
   and possibly the velocities of the spacecraft and all the target bodies
   of interest. The purpose of the SPK---which stands for S(pacecraft) and
   P(lanet) Kernel---file is to allow ephemerides for any collection of
   solar system bodies to be combined under a common file format, and
   accessed by a common set of subroutines.
 
   Historically, ephemerides for spacecraft have been organized differently
   from those for planets and satellites. They are usually generated
   through different processes and using different representations.
   However, there is no essential reason for keeping them separate. A
   spacecraft, planet, satellite, comet, or asteroid has a position and
   velocity relative to some center of mass and reference frame.
   Consequently all of these objects can be represented in an SPK file.
 
   Consider the Galileo mission. Some of the objects of special interest to
   the Galileo mission are:
 
      Galileo Spacecraft
      Galileo Probe
      Earth
      Moon
      Earth Moon Barycenter
      Venus
      Sun
      Solar System Barycenter (S.S.B.)
      Asteroid Ida
      Ida's Satellite Dactyl
      Asteroid Gaspra
      Comet Shoemaker-Levy
      Jupiter System Barycenter (J.B.)
      Jupiter
      Io
      Ganymede
      Europa
      Callysto
      Goldstone Tracking Station.
 
   Each of these objects has a position and velocity (state) relative to
   some other object. The graph below illustrates which objects will be
   used as reference objects for representing the states of others.
 
                             +Gll

                              |                  + Gll
                              o Earth
                             / \
                            /   \
                           /     + Gll
                          o
                       Goldstone
 
   This graph is somewhat complicated. Nevertheless, the complete ephemeris
   history for all of these objects can be captured in a single SPK file.
 
   (Although we can store the entire ephemeris history illustrated above in
   a single SPK file, for the sake of data management a project is likely
   to use several SPK files. However, even in this case, all of the SPK
   files can be used simultaneously.)
 
   The SPK format is supported by a collection of subroutines that are part
   of the SPICELIB library---the major component of the SPICE Toolkit. This
   family of SPK subroutines provides the following capabilities:
 
       1.   Insert ephemeris data from some source into an SPK file.
 
       2.   Make the ephemeris data in one or more SPK files available to a
            user's program.
 
       3.   Return the apparent, true, or geometric state (position and
            velocity) of one ephemeris object as seen from another in some
            convenient reference frame.
 
   The SPK software allows you to ignore the potential ephemeris complexity
   associated with the a mission such as Galileo and allows you to more
   directly compute various quantities that depend upon the position or
   velocity of one object as seen from another.
 
 
SPK Files
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   SPICE software writes SPK files in a binary (non-ASCII) format
   structured in a NAIF developed abstract file architecture called Double
   Precision Array File (DAF). The DAF architecture and supporting software
   is discussed in the DAF Required Reading document, daf.req. The SPICE
   file identification word occupying the first eight bytes of a properly
   created binary SPK file is ``DAF/SPK ''. For more information on SPICE
   identification words refer to the Kernel Required Reading document,
   kernel.req. If you need only use SPK files as a data source or if you
   will use a SPICE utility program for creating SPK files, you can safely
   ignore aspects of the DAF system not covered by this document. On the
   other hand, if you plan to write software for creating SPK files you
   will probably need to familiarize yourself with the DAF software
   contained in SPICELIB. The particular aspects of the DAF architecture
   that are relevant to the SPK format are discussed later in this document
   (see below---SPK Format).
 
   Since SPKs are written as binary files, the specific binary format
   depends on the computer architecture on which the SPK was created, in
   the case of SPICE either big-endian or little-endian (NAIF no longer
   supports DEC platforms).
 
 
Use of SPK files between computers
 
   NAIF extended the DAF capability in SPICE Toolkit delivery N0052 to
   allow reading of both big-endian and little-endian binary DAF files by
   all toolkits. This process is a run-time interpretation of non-native
   binary files. Run-time interpretation does not yet work for any file
   built upon the SPICE "DAS" architecture.
 
   NAIF provides two utility programs---TOXFR and SPACIT for converting
   SPICE binary kernels to a ``transfer format'' suitable for text copying
   from one computer to another. Once the transfer format file has been
   copied, the SPICE utilities TOBIN and SPACIT are available for
   converting the transfer format file to the binary format suitable for
   the new machine.
 
   The utilities TOXFR and TOBIN are ``command line'' programs. To convert
   a binary kernel to transfer format you simply type TOXFR followed by the
   name of the binary kernel at your terminal prompt.
 
      prompt> toxfr spk_file
 
   To convert a transfer format to binary format, you type TOBIN followed
   by the name of the transfer format kernel.
 
      prompt> tobin transfer_file
 
   The utility SPACIT is an interactive program that allows you to select a
   function from a menu to perform on a file. This program can also be used
   to convert to or from transfer format files.
 
   Note that transfer format files cannot be ``loaded'' into a SPICE based
   program to retrieve ephemeris data. Only binary format files can be used
   for retrieving ephemeris data with SPICE software.
 
   CSPICE (and by extension Icy and Mice) uses the same binary kernels as
   does SPICELIB.
 
 
Examining SPK files
 
   Since SPK files are binary files, you can't just open them with your
   favorite text editor to determine which ephemeris objects are
   represented in the file. Instead you need to use one of the SPICE
   utility programs that allow you to summarize the ephemeris contents of
   an SPK file. The first of these is SPACIT which was introduced above.
   The second is the command line utility BRIEF.
 
   BRIEF gives a quick summary of the contents of the file and supports a
   wide set of summary options. SPACIT on the other hand, provides
   summaries that are more detailed and reflect closely the actual internal
   structure of the file. Unless you need the more detailed summary, you'll
   probably find BRIEF to be a better tool for examining the contents of an
   SPK file.
 
 
Meta Data in the SPK file
 
   SPICE kernels may contain ``meta'' data that describe the contents,
   intended use, accuracy, etc. of the kernel. This meta data is called the
   ``comments'' portion of the kernel. Many SPK files contain comments that
   can help you decide upon the suitability of the kernel for your
   application. Two SPICE utilities are available for examining the
   comments of a binary kernel---COMMNT and SPACIT.
 
   We've already introduced SPACIT. COMMNT is similar to SPACIT in that it
   too is an interactive program. However, COMMNT also allows you to modify
   the comments of an SPK file. Using COMMNT you can delete the comments of
   an SPK file, extract the comments to a text file, or append the text
   from some text file to the comments already present in the kernel.
 
   If you create SPK files, we strongly recommend that you add comments to
   the kernel that describe who created it, expected usage of the kernel,
   and the expected accuracy of the position/velocity information contained
   in the kernel. A comment template is provided in the appendix
   ``COMMENTS''.
 
   Warning: If you add comments to an SPK (or other binary kernel) using
   COMMNT, you must wait for the program to complete the task before
   exiting the program. Failure to wait for COMMNT to finish its work will
   result in irreparable corruption of the binary kernel. (See the COMMNT
   User's Guide, commnt.ug, [212] for details on the use of COMMNT).
 
 
Terminology
 
   Throughout this document we shall be using terms such as reference
   frame, state, ephemeris time, etc. We include a brief review of these
   terms below.
 
         Reference Frame      A reference frame is a Cartesian coordinate
                              system with three axes---x, y and z. The axes
                              are mutually orthogonal. The center of the
                              frame is the origin of the Cartesian
                              reference system. For the reference frames in
                              SPICE, the positions of the axes are
                              typically defined by some observable object.
                              For example, in the J2000 reference frame,
                              the x-axis is defined to lie in the
                              intersection of two planes: the plane of the
                              Earth's equator and the plane of the Earth's
                              orbit. The z-axis is perpendicular to the
                              Earth's equator. The y-axis completes a
                              right-handed system. The center of the frame
                              is typically taken to be the solar system
                              barycenter. (Note we are not attempting to
                              rigorously define the J2000 frame here. We
                              are only illustrating how reference frames
                              are defined. Many more details are required
                              for a rigorous definition of the J2000 frame.
                              These details are given in the SPICE document
                              ``Frames'' [349].)
 
         State                A state is an array of six double precision
                              numbers. The first three numbers give the x,
                              y, and z coordinates respectively for the
                              position of some object relative to another
                              object in some Cartesian reference frame. The
                              next three numbers give the velocity ( dx/dt,
                              dy/dt and dz/dt respectively) of the object
                              with respect to the same reference frame.
 
         Inertial Frame       An inertial frame, is one in which Newton's
                              laws of motion apply. A frame whose axes are
                              not moving with respect to the observed
                              positions of distant galaxies and quasars
                              approximates an inertial frame.
 
         Non-Inertial Frame   A non-inertial frame is a frame that rotates
                              with respect to the celestial background. For
                              example a frame whose axes are fixed with
                              respect to the features on the surface of the
                              Earth is a non-inertial frame.
 
         Ephemeris Time (ET   Ephemeris time, ET, is the independent
                              variable in the equations of motion that
                              describe the positions and velocities of
                              objects in the solar system. In SPICELIB we
                              treat ET as a synonym for Barycentric
                              Dynamical Time. As far as has been
                              experimentally determined, an atomic clock
                              placed at the solar system barycenter, would
                              provide a faithful measure of ET.
 
         Seconds Past 2000    In the SPK system times are specified as a
                              count of seconds past a particular
                              epoch---the epoch of the J2000 reference
                              frame. This reference epoch is within a
                              second or two of the UTC epoch: 12:01:02.184
                              Jan 1, 2000 UTC. (See the document time.req
                              for a more thorough discussion of the J2000
                              epoch). Epochs prior to this epoch are
                              represented as negative numbers. The
                              ``units'' of ET are designated in several
                              different ways: seconds past 2000, seconds
                              past J2000, seconds past the Julian year
                              2000, seconds past the epoch of the J2000
                              frame. All of these phrases mean the same
                              thing and are used interchangeably throughout
                              this document.
 
         SPK segment          The trajectories of objects in SPK files are
                              represented in pieces called segments. A
                              segment represents some arc of the full
                              trajectory of an object. Each segment
                              contains information that specifies the
                              trajectory of a particular object relative to
                              a particular center of motion in a fixed
                              reference frame over some particular interval
                              of time. From the point of view of the SPK
                              system segments are the atomic portions of a
                              trajectory.
 
 
The SPK Family of Subroutines
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   SPICELIB contains a family of subroutines that are designed specifically
   for use with SPK files. The name of each routine begins with the letters
   `SPK', followed by a two- or three-character mnemonic. For example, the
   routine that returns the state of one body with respect to another is
   named SPKEZR, pronounced `S-P-K-easier'. A complete list of mnemonics,
   translations, and calling sequences can be found at the end of this
   document.
 
   Each subroutine is prefaced by a complete SPICELIB header, which
   describes inputs, outputs, restrictions, and exceptions, discusses the
   context in which the subroutine can be used, and shows typical examples
   of its use. Any discussion of the subroutines in this document is
   intended as an introduction: the final documentation for any subroutine
   is its header.
 
   Whenever an SPK subroutine appears in an example, the translation of the
   mnemonic part of its name will appear to the right of the reference, in
   braces. We also continue with the convention of distinguishing between
   input and output arguments by listing input arguments in lower case and
   enclosed in angle brackets. For example,
 
       CALL SPKEZR ( <targ>,  <et>, <frame>,
      .              <aberr>, <obs>,
      .              STATE,    LT          ) { Easier state }
 
   All subroutines and functions, including those whose names do not begin
   with `SPK', are from SPICELIB.
 
   Code examples will make use of the structured DO ... END DO and DO WHILE
   ... END DO statements supported by most Fortran compilers.
 
   SPK readers are available to perform the following functions.
 
       1.   Determine the apparent, true, or geometric state of a body with
            respect to another body relative to a user specified reference
            frame.
 
       2.   Determine the apparent, true, or geometric state of a body with
            respect to an observer with having a user-supplied state.
 
       3.   Determine the geometric state of a body with respect to the
            solar system barycenter.
 
       4.   Determine the geometric state of a target body with respect to
            its center of motion for a particular segment.
 
       5.   Determine, from a list of SPK files supplied by the calling
            program, the files and segments needed to fulfill a request for
            the state of a particular body.
 
 
Computing States
 
   SPKEZR is the most powerful of the SPK readers. It determines the
   apparent, true, or geometric state of one body (the target) as seen by a
   second body (the observer) relative to a user specified reference frame.
 
       CALL SPKEZR ( <targ>,  <et>, <frame>,
      .              <aberr>, <obs>,
      .              STATE,    LT          ) { Easier state }
 
   The subroutine accepts five inputs---target body, epoch, reference
   frame, aberration correction type, and observing body---and returns two
   outputs---state of the target body as seen from the observing body, and
   one-way light-time from the target body to the observing body.
 
   The target body, observing body and frame are identified by strings that
   contain the names of these items. For example, to determine the state of
   Triton as seen from the Voyager-2 spacecraft relative to the J2000
   reference frame
 
       CALL SPKEZR ( 'TRITON', ET, 'J2000', ABERR,
      .              'VOYAGER-2',   STATE,  LT )      { Easier state }
 
   By definition, the ephemerides in SPK files are continuous: the user can
   obtain states at any epoch within the interval of coverage. Epochs are
   always specified in ephemeris seconds past the epoch of the J2000
   reference system (Julian Ephemeris Date 2451545.0 ) For example, to
   determine the state of Triton as seen from Voyager-2 at Julian Ephemeris
   Date 2447751.8293,
 
       ET = ( 2447751.8293D0 - J2000() ) * SPD()
 
       CALL SPKEZR ( 'TRITON', ET, 'J2000', <aberr>,
      .              'VOYAGER-2',   STATE,  LT )      { Easier state }
 
   where the function J2000 returns the epoch of the J2000 frame (Julian
   Ephemeris Date 2451545.0) and the function SPD returns the number of
   seconds per Julian day (86400.0).
 
   The ephemeris data in an SPK file may be referenced to a number of
   different reference frames. States returned by SPKEZR do not have to be
   referenced to any of these ``native'' frames. The user can specify that
   states are to be returned in any of the frames recognized by the frame
   subsystem. For example, to determine the state of Triton as seen from
   Voyager-2, referenced to the J2000 ecliptic reference frame,
 
       CALL SPKEZR ( 'TRITON', ET, 'ECLIPJ2000', ABERR,
      .              'VOYAGER-2',   STATE,       LT )    { Easier state }
 
   SPKEZR returns apparent, true, or geometric states depending on the
   value of the aberration correction type flag ABERR.
 
   Apparent states are corrected for planetary aberration, which is the
   composite of the apparent angular displacement produced by motion of the
   observer (stellar aberration) and the actual motion of the target body
   (correction for light-time). True states are corrected for light-time
   only. Geometric states are uncorrected.
 
   Instead of using the potentially confusing terms `true' and `geometric'
   to specify the type of state to be returned, SPKEZR requires the
   specific corrections to be named. To compute apparent states, specify
   correction for both light-time and stellar aberration: `LT+S'. To
   compute true states, specify correction for light-time only: `LT'. To
   compute geometric states, specify no correction: `NONE'.
 
   In all cases, the one-way light-time from the target to the observer is
   returned along with the state.
 
 
Computing States using Constant-Velocity or Constant-Position Objects
 
   Objects such as tracking stations, rover or spacecraft components, or
   fixed surface points can be treated by the SPK subsystem as ephemeris
   objects just as easily as bodies such as planets and natural satellites.
   For example, using an SPK file for the geocentric location of a tracking
   station enables SPKEZR to compute states of targets relative to the
   tracking station, providing all needed kernel data have been loaded.
 
   However, it is not always convenient to create an SPK file to provide
   data for an ephemeris object, particularly when that object's location
   is known only at run time.
 
   For an object that has constant velocity, relative to a specified center
   of motion, in a specified reference frame, SPICE offers a set of
   routines to compute states relative to other ephemeris objects, where
   the other objects have ephemeris data provided by SPK files:
 
      SPKCPO  {SPK, constant position observer state}
      SPKCPT  {SPK, constant position target state}
      SPKCVO  {SPK, constant velocity observer state}
      SPKCVT  {SPK, constant velocity target state}
 
   The ``constant position'' routines have simplified interfaces; these
   handle the special case where the constant velocity is zero.
 
   Each of the above routines requires that sufficient SPK data be
   available to compute the state of the center of motion, relative to the
   other ephemeris object, of the constant-velocity or constant-position
   object.
 
   States computed by SPK routines for constant-velocity or
   constant-position objects optionally can be corrected for light time and
   stellar aberration, just as is done by SPKEZR.
 
   A limitation of representing objects using constant velocities or
   positions, instead of creating SPK files to provide the ephemerides of
   those objects, is that high-level SPICE geometry routines such as SINCPT
   or SUBPT cannot work with such objects---these routines require SPK data
   for all ephemeris objects participating in the computations they
   perform.
 
 
The Computation of Light Time
 
   The light time corrected position component of a state vector returned
   by the SPK system is the 3-vector difference
 
      TARGET_SSB ( ET + S*LT )  - OBSERVER_SSB ( ET )
 
   where TARGET_SSB and OBSERVER_SSB give the position of the target and
   observer relative to the solar system barycenter, and where S is -1 for
   reception corrections (where light travels from the target to the
   observer) and 1 for transmission corrections (where light travels from
   the observer to the target).
 
   LT is the unique number that satisfies:
 
            | TARGET_SSB ( ET + S*LT )  -  OBSERVER_SSB ( ET ) |
      LT =  ----------------------------------------------------
                              Speed of Light
 
   where
 
      | position |
 
   indicates the length of a position vector.
 
   The velocity portion of the returned state is the derivative with
   respect to the observation time ET of the light time corrected position.
 
   Mathematically, LT can be computed to arbitrary precision via the
   following algorithm:
 
      LT_0 = 0
 
 
 
              | TARGET_SSB ( ET - LT_(i-1) ) - OBSERVER_SSB ( ET ) |
      LT_i =  ------------------------------------------------------
                                 Speed of Light
 
 
         for i = 1, ...
 
   It can be shown that the sequence LT_0, LT_1, LT_2, ... converges to LT
   geometrically. Moreover, it can be shown that the difference between
   LT_i and LT satisfies the following inequality.
 
                                    i
      | LT - LT_i | < LT_i * ( V/C )  / ( 1 - V/C )
 
         for i = 1, ...
 
   where V is the maximum speed of the target body with respect to the
   solar system barycenter and C is the speed of light.
 
 
Precision of Light Time Computations
 
   Let's examine the error we make if we use LT_2 as an approximation for
   LT. This is an analysis of precision; we'll ignore errors in the data
   and those in the input times.
 
   For nearly all objects in the solar system V is less than 60 km/sec. The
   value of C is approximately 300000 km/sec. Thus V/C is 2.0E-4, and the
   one iteration solution for LT (in which the target-SSB vector is
   corrected once) has a potential relative error of not more than 4.0E-8.
   This is a potential light time error of approximately 2.0E-5 seconds per
   astronomical unit of distance separating the observer and target. Thus
   as long as the observer and target are separated by less than 50
   Astronomical Units, the error in the light time returned using option
   `LT' is less than 1 millisecond.
 
   For this reason, SPICE uses LT_2 to approximate LT when you request a
   light time corrected state by setting the aberration correction argument
   in SPKEZR to any of `LT', `XLT', `LT+S', `XLT+S'.
 
   The maximum error in the light time corrected target-SSB position vector
   is larger by a factor of C/V than V times the maximum relative light
   time error. This is because the (i-1)st light time estimate is used to
   compute the ith estimate of target-SSB position vector. Given the
   assumptions above, the maximum position error for the `LT'-style
   correction is bounded by
 
      60 km/s * (1/(2.0E-4)) * 2*1.0E-5 s / AU
 
   or 6 km per astronomical unit of distance separating the observer and
   target.
 
   In practice, the difference between positions obtained using
   one-iteration and converged light time is usually much smaller than the
   value computed above and can be insignificant. For example, for the
   spacecraft Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express, the position
   error for the one-iteration light time correction, applied to the
   spacecraft-to-Mars center
 
   You can make SPKEZR (and other applicable SPK routines) compute a better
   approximation to LT and compute more accurate light-time corrected
   states by commanding that it compute a ``converged Newtonian'' value for
   LT. To do this set the light time portion of the aberration correction
   specification to `CN' (the possible such aberration correction
   specifications are`CN', `XCN', `CN+S', or `XCN+S'). SPKEZR will then
   return a converged value, usually equal to LT_4, as the approximation
   for light time; the returned state will be converged as well. Then the
   maximum error in LT_4 is less than
 
      1.0E-3 * (V/C)**2 seconds
 
   which is less than 4e-11 seconds for any observer/target pair in the
   solar system that satisfies the assumptions above. The corresponding
   position error bound is 1.2 cm at a separation of 50 AU.
 
   However, you should note that this is a purely Newtonian approximation
   to the light time. To model the actual light time between target and
   observer one must take into account effects due to General relativity.
   These may be as high as a few hundredths of a millisecond for some
   geometric cases.
 
   The routines in the SPK family do not attempt to perform either general
   or special relativistic corrections in computing the various aberration
   corrections. For many applications relativistic corrections are not
   worth the expense of added computation cycles. If, however, your
   application requires these additional corrections we suggest you consult
   the astronomical almanac (page B36) for a discussion of how to carry out
   these corrections.
 
 
Light Time Corrected Non-Inertial States
 
   When we observe a distant object, we don't see it as it is at the moment
   of observation. We see it as it was when the photons we have sensed were
   emitted by or reflected from the object. Thus when we look at Mars
   through a telescope, we see it not as it is now, but rather as it was
   one ``light-time'' ago. This is true not only for the position of Mars,
   but for its orientation as well.
 
   Suppose that a large balloon has been launched into the Martian
   atmosphere and we want to determine the Mars bodyfixed state of the
   balloon as seen from Earth at the epoch ET. We need to determine both
   the light time corrected position of the balloon, and the light time
   corrected orientation of Mars. To do this we compute two light times.
   The light time to the center of the Mars bodyfixed frame (i.e. the
   center of Mars) and the light time to the balloon. Call the light time
   to the center of the Mars frame LT_F and call the light time to the
   balloon LT_T. The light time corrected state of the balloon relative to
   the Mars bodyfixed frame is the location of the balloon at ET - LT_T in
   the bodyfixed frame of Mars as oriented at ET - LT_F.
 
   SPKEZR carries out all of these computations automatically. In this case
   the computation would be computed by a subroutine call similar to this:
 
       CALL SPKEZR ( 'Mars_balloon', <et>, 'IAU_MARS', 'LT', 'EARTH',
      .               STATE, LT  )
 
   SPKEZR uses the following rules when computing states.
 
       1.   When no corrections are requested from SPKEZR (ABCORR =
            'NONE'), the state of the target is determined at the request
            time ET and is represented in the specified reference frame as
            it is oriented at time ET.
 
       2.   When light time corrections are requested from SPKEZR (ABCORR =
            'LT'), two light times are determined: LT_F the light time to
            the center of the specified reference frame, and LT_T the light
            time to the target. The state of the target is given as it was
            at ET - LT_T in the frame as it was oriented at ET - LT_F.
 
       3.   When light time and stellar aberrations are requested from
            SPKEZR (ABCORR = 'LT+S'), both LT_F and LT_T are again
            computed. The state of the target at ET - LT_T is corrected for
            stellar aberration and represented in the reference frame as it
            was oriented at ET - LT_F.
 
       4.   Light-time corrected velocities are computed taking into
            account the rate of change of light time both between observer
            and target and between observer and the center of the
            non-inertial frame. The rate of change of the target frame's
            orientation is accounted for as well.
 
   In the actual implementation of SPKEZR a few short cuts are taken. When
   light time requested states relative to an inertial frame are requested,
   the orientation of the frame is not corrected for light time. The
   orientation of an inertial frame at ET - LT_F is the same as the
   orientation of the frame at ET. Computations involving inertial frames
   take advantage of this observation and avoid redundant computations.
 
 
An example
 
   Here we illustrate how you could use SPKEZR together with other SPICELIB
   routines to determine if at a particular epoch ET the Mars Global
   Surveyor spacecraft is occulted by Mars.
 
   We will need the lengths of the axes of the triaxial ellipsoid that is
   used to model the surface of Mars. Either of the SPICELIB routines
   BODVCD or BODVRD will retrieve this information from a loaded PCK file.
   BODVRD uses the name of the body, while BODVCD uses the NAIF ID code for
   Mars (499) to retrieve the lengths of the axes. We may call BODVCD as
   shown:
 
      CALL BODVCD ( 499, 'RADII', 3, NVALS, AXES )
 
      A = AXES(1)
      B = AXES(2)
      C = AXES(3)
 
   Next we compute the state of Mars relative to Earth and the state of MGS
   relative to Earth in the Mars bodyfixed frame.
 
       CALL SPKEZR ( 'MARS',  ET, 'IAU_MARS', 'LT+S', 'EARTH',
      .               MARSST, LT )
       CALL SPKEZR ( 'MGS',   ET, 'IAU_MARS', 'LT+S', 'EARTH',
      .               MGSST,  LT ) {Easier State}
 
   Compute the apparent position of the Earth relative to Mars in the
   apparent Mars bodyfixed frame. This means simply negating the components
   of MARSST. The SPICELIB routine VMINUS carries out this task.
 
      CALL VMINUS ( MARSST, ESTATE )
 
   Determine if the line of sight from Earth to MGS intersects the surface
   of Mars. The SPICELIB routine SURFPT will find this intersection point
   if it exists.
 
      CALL SURFPT ( ESTATE, MGSST, A, B, C, POINT, FOUND )
 
   Finally, if a point of intersection was found, was it between the Earth
   and the MGS spacecraft. To find out we can compare the distances between
   the intersection point and the spacecraft. The SPICELIB function VNORM
   computes the length of the vector from Earth to MGS. The function VDIST
   computes the distance between the point and the Earth.
 
      IF ( FOUND ) THEN
         BETWN = VDIST( ESTATE, POINT ) .LT. VNORM ( MGSST )
      ELSE
         BETWN = .FALSE.
      END IF
 
      IF ( BETWN ) THEN
         WRITE (*,*) 'MGS is behind Mars'
      ELSE
         WRITE (*,*) 'MGS is not behind Mars'
      END IF
 
 
Integer ID Codes Used in SPK
 
   Low level SPK software uses integer codes to identify ephemeris objects,
   reference frames and data representation, etc. At low levels of the
   SPICE system only integer codes are used to communicate information
   about objects. To some extent, these codes are a historical artifact in
   the design of the SPICE system. Nevertheless, these integer codes
   provide economies in the development of SPICE software.
 
   High-level SPICE software uses names (character strings) to refer to the
   various SPICE objects and translates between names and integer codes.
   Thus to some extent you can disregard the integer codes used by the
   SPICE internals. However, occasionally, due to the introduction of new
   ephemeris objects, the name translation software will be unable to find
   a name associated with an ID code. To retrieve states for such an object
   you will need to use the integer code for the object in question. If you
   are using SPKEZR, you can supply this integer code as a quoted string.
   For example the following two subroutine calls will both return the
   state of TRITON as seen from Voyager-2. (The NAIF integer code for
   TRITON is 801; the NAIF integer code for Voyager 2 is -32).
 
       CALL SPKEZR ( 'TRITON', ET, 'ECLIPJ2000', ABERR,
      .              'VOYAGER-2',   STATE,       LT )    { Easier state }
 
 
       CALL SPKEZR ( '801',   ET, 'ECLIPJ2000', ABERR,
      .              '-32',        STATE,       LT )    { Easier state }
 
   Consult the NAIF IDS Required Reading file, naif_ids.req, for the
   current list of body codes recognized by the SPICE Toolkit software.
 
 
SPKEZ and SPKGEO
 
   SPKEZR relies upon two lower level routines that may be useful under
   certain circumstances.
 
   The routine SPKEZ performs the same functions as SPKEZR. The only
   difference is the means by which objects are specified. SPKEZ requires
   that the target and observing bodies be specified using the NAIF integer
   ID codes for those bodies.
 
      SPKEZ ( <targ_id>, <et>, <frame>, <corr>, <obj_id>,
               STATE,    LT )  { SPK Easy }
 
   The NAIF-ID codes for ephemeris objects are listed in the NAIF_IDS
   required reading file, naif_ids.req.
 
   SPKEZ is useful in those situations when you ID codes for objects stored
   as integers. There is also a modest efficiency gain when using integer
   ID codes instead of character strings to specify targets and observers.
 
   The routine SPKGEO returns only geometric (uncorrected) states. The
   following two subroutine calls are equivalent.
 
       CALL SPKEZ  ( <targ_id>, <et>, <frame>,
      .              'NONE',    <obj_id>,
      .              STATE,     LT )               {SPK Easy}
 
       CALL SPKGEO ( <targ_id>, <et>, <frame>,
                     <obj_id>,
      .              STATE,     LT )               {SPK Geometric }
 
   SPKGEO involves slightly less overhead than does SPKEZ and thus may be
   marginally faster than calling SPKEZ.
 
 
Loading Files
 
   Note that SPKEZR, SPKEZ and SPKGEO do not require the name of an SPK
   file as input. These routines rely on the lower level routine in the SPK
   subsystem to maintain a database of ephemeris files. Your application
   program indicates which files are to be used by passing their names to
   routine FURNSH -- ``generic loader'' that can be used to load SPICE
   kernel files of any type.
 
      DO I = 1, N
         CALL FURNSH ( ephem(I) )      { Load kernel file }
      END DO
 
   In general, a state returned by SPKEZR is built from several more
   primitive states. Consider the following diagram, which shows some of
   the states that might be needed to determine the state of the Galileo
   spacecraft as seen from Earth:

   (SSB and EMB are the solar system and Earth-Moon barycenters.)
 
   Each state is computed from a distinct segment. The segments may reside
   in a single SPK file, or may be contained in as many as five separate
   files. For example, the segments needed to compute the Earth-spacecraft
   state shown above might come from the following set of files:
 
      CALL FURNSH ( 'barycenters.bsp'    )  { Load kernel file }
      CALL FURNSH ( 'planet-centers.bsp' )  { Load kernel file }
      CALL FURNSH ( 'satellites.bsp'     )  { Load kernel file }
      CALL FURNSH ( 'spacecraft.bsp'     )  { Load kernel file }
 
   or from the following set:
 
      CALL FURNSH ( 'earth.bsp'      )      { Load kernel file }
      CALL FURNSH ( 'jupiter.bsp'    )      { Load kernel file }
      CALL FURNSH ( 'spacecraft.bsp' )      { Load kernel file }
 
 
Data Precedence
 
   An SPK file may contain any number of segments. A single file may
   contain overlapping segments: segments containing data for the same body
   over a common interval. When this happens, the latest segment in a file
   supersedes any competing segments earlier in the file. Similarly, the
   latest file loaded supersedes any earlier files. In effect, several
   loaded files become equivalent to one large file.
 
 
Unloading Files
 
   The number of SPK files that may be loaded at any one time is limited
   but very large -- up to 1000 total for all loaded SPK, CK, and binary
   PCK files combined. Although unlikely, in some cases your application
   program may need to unload some SPK files to make room for others or to
   remove a particular SPK from the set of loaded data. An SPK file may be
   unloaded by supplying its name to subroutine UNLOAD -- ``generic
   unloader'' that can be used to unload SPICE kernel of any type. The
   sequence of statements shown below,
 
      CALL FURNSH ( 'file.a' )     { Load kernel file }
      CALL FURNSH ( 'file.b' )     { Load kernel file }
      CALL FURNSH ( 'file.c' )     { Load kernel file }
      CALL UNLOAD ( 'file.b' )     { Unload kernel file }
      CALL FURNSH ( 'file.d' )     { Load kernel file }
      CALL UNLOAD ( 'file.c' )     { Unload kernel file }
 
   is equivalent to the following (shorter) sequence:
 
      CALL FURNSH ( 'file.a' )     { Load kernel file }
      CALL FURNSH ( 'file.d' )     { Load kernel file }
 
 
Getting Coverage Summary
 
   The SPICELIB includes two routines for obtaining information about the
   contents of an SPK file from within an application.
 
   The SPKOBJ routine provides an API via which an application can find the
   set of bodies for which a specified SPK file contains data. The body IDs
   are returned in a SPICE ``set'' data structure (see sets.req).
 
   The SPKCOV routine provides an API via which an application can find the
   time periods for which a specified SPK file provides data for an body of
   interest. The coverage information is a set of disjoint time intervals
   returned in a SPICE ``window'' data structure (see windows.req).
 
   Refer to the headers of SPKOBJ and SPKCOV for details on the use of
   those routines.
 
 
Loading Auxiliary Files
 
   Prior to the inclusion of non-inertial frames in the SPK system, the
   states of objects computed by the SPK system required only that you load
   the correct SPK files and call the correct subroutines. The inertial
   frame transformations needed for converting from one inertial frame to
   another are ``hard wired'' into the SPICE system. The transformations
   are part of the object code of the SPICELIB library---no additional data
   need be supplied to compute these transformations. This approach to
   carrying out inertial frame transformations was chosen because the
   transformations are compactly represented and do not change as the
   result of further observations. They are essentially definitions.
 
   On the other hand, the orientation of non-inertial frames with respect
   to other frames are almost always the result of observation. They are
   improved and extended as further observations are made. For some of
   these frames (such as spacecraft fixed frames) vary large data sets are
   needed to express the orientation of the frame with respect to other
   frames. Frame transformations that are a function of time and require
   megabytes of data are not suitable for encapsulation in FORTRAN source
   code. As a result, in the SPICE system, the computation of non-inertial
   frame transformations depends upon data stored in other SPICE kernels.
   If you request states relative to a non-inertial frame or use
   ephemerides that are represented relative to non-inertial frames you
   must load additional SPICE kernels. The method by which an auxiliary
   kernel is loaded depends upon the type of the kernel.
 
   There are currently five classes of reference frames that are supported
   by the SPICE system. We give a brief overview of these frames here. For
   a more thorough discussion of the various types of frames see the
   recommended reading file ``frames.req.''
 
   Inertial frames
 
            Inertial frames are built into the SPICE system. You don't need
            to do anything to make their definitions available to your
            program. Inertial frames have NAIF ID codes whose values are in
            the range from 1 to 10000.
 
   PCK frames
 
            PCK frames are bodyfixed frames. The orientation of a PCK frame
            is always expressed relative to an inertial frame. The
            relationship between a PCK frame and its associated inertial
            frame is provided by a PCK kernel. PCK frames have ID codes
            between 10000 and 100000. There are two types of PCK
            kernels---binary and text. Binary PCK kernels are loaded (and
            unloaded) in a fashion analogous to the loading and unloading
            of SPK files. To load a binary PCK file
 
               CALL FURNSH ( <file> )
 
            To unload a binary PCK file
 
               CALL UNLOAD ( <file> )
 
            text based PCK files are loaded via the routine FURNSH.
 
               CALL FURNSH ( <file> )
 
   CK Frames
 
            CK frames are frames that are defined relative to a spacecraft
            structure. The orientation of the structure is provided through
            a binary SPICE kernel called a C-kernel. The ID codes for
            C-kernel frames are negative and usually less than -999. A
            C-kernel frame may be defined relative to any other kind of
            frame. (Most existing C-kernels are defined relative to
            inertial frames.)
 
            C-kernels are loaded and unloaded using the same loader
            routines as used to load and unload SPK kernels. To load a
            C-kernel
 
               CALL FURNSH ( <file> )
 
            To unload a C-kernel
 
               CALL UNLOAD ( <file> )
 
            The times used to represent C-kernels are spacecraft clock
            times---not ET. The relationship between ET and spacecraft
            clock times is stored in a SPICE text kernel called a
            spacecraft clock kernel---usually abbreviated as SCLK
            (ess-clock) kernel. To retrieve states relative to a CK frame
            you need to make the relationship between ET and the spacecraft
            clock available to your program by loading the appropriate SCLK
            kernel. SCLK kernels are loaded via the routine FURNSH.
 
               CALL FURNSH ( <sclk_file_name> )
 
   TK Frames
 
            TK frames (short for Text Kernel frames) are frames that are
            defined via a SPICE text kernel. These frames can be
            transformed to another reference frame via a constant rotation
            matrix. Typical examples are topocentric frames and instrument
            frames. TK frames are loaded via the routine FURNSH.
 
               CALL FURNSH ( <TK_frame_file> )
 
   Dynamic Frames
 
            Dynamic frames, like TK frames, are defined via a SPICE text
            kernel. A dynamic frame has time-varying rotation relative to
            its base frame. A dynamic frame can be defined by two
            time-varying vectors, by a set of precession, nutation, and
            obliquity models, or by a set of Euler angles. Typical examples
            are the geocentric solar ecliptic frame or the Earth true
            equator and true equinox of date frame. Dynamic frames are
            loaded via the routine FURNSH.
 
               CALL FURNSH ( <Dynamic_frame_file> )
 
   In addition to the files mentioned above, it may be necessary to load a
   ``frame definition'' file along with the one of the SPICE kernels listed
   above. (If the producer of the file has done his or her homework this
   step should be unnecessary.) The frame definition file is a SPICE text
   kernel that specifies the type of the frame, the center of the frame,
   the name of the frame, and its ID code. (See frames.req for more details
   concerning frame definitions.)
 
   As is evident from the above discussion, the use of non-inertial frames
   requires more data management on the part of the user of the SPICE
   system. However, this data management problem is not a new problem. In
   previous versions of the SPICE system the same kernels would have been
   required. Moreover, in previous versions of the SPICE system, you would
   have been required to perform all non-inertial transformations in your
   own code. With the inclusion of non-inertial frames in the SPK system,
   we have relieved you of some of the tasks associated with non-inertial
   frames.
 
 
SPK File Structure
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   An SPK file is made up of one or more data ``segments'' and a
   ``comment'' area. These components are described below.
 
 
Segments--The Fundamental SPK Building Blocks
 
   An SPK file contains one or more ``segments.'' Each segment contains
   ephemeris data sufficient to compute the geometric state (position and
   velocity) of one solar system body (the `target') with respect to
   another (the `center') at any epoch throughout some finite interval of
   time.
 
   Either body may be a spacecraft, a planet or planet barycenter, a
   satellite, a comet, an asteroid, a tracking station, a roving vehicle,
   or an arbitrary point for which an ephemeris has been calculated. Each
   body in the solar system is associated with a unique integer code. A
   list of names and codes for the planets, major satellites, spacecraft,
   asteroids and comets can be found in the document naif_ids.req
 
   The states computed from the ephemeris data in a segment must be
   referenced to a single, recognized reference frame.
 
   The data in each segment are stored as an array of double precision
   numbers. The summary for the array, called a `descriptor', has two
   double precision components:
 
       1.   The initial epoch of the interval for which ephemeris data are
            contained in the segment, given in ephemeris seconds past
            Julian year 2000.
 
       2.   The final epoch of the interval for which ephemeris data are
            contained in the segment, given in ephemeris seconds past
            Julian year 2000.
 
   The descriptor has six integer components:
 
       1.   The NAIF integer code for the target.
 
       2.   The NAIF integer code for the center.
 
       3.   The NAIF integer code for the reference frame.
 
       4.   The integer code for the representation (type of ephemeris
            data).
 
       5.   The initial address of the array.
 
       6.   The final address of the array.
 
   In addition to a descriptor, each array also has a name. The name of
   each array may contain up to 40 characters. This space may be used to
   store a brief description of the segment. For example, the name may
   contain pedigree information concerning the segment or may contain the
   name of the object whose position is recorded in the segment.
 
 
Segment Order and Priority
 
   Segments within an SPK file need not be ordered according to time;
   segments covering (that is, providing data for) a later time period may
   precede segments covering an earlier time period.
 
   However, segment order does imply priority. For a given target body,
   segment priority increases with distance from the start of the file:
   segments closer to the end of the file have higher priority than
   segments for the same target body that occur earlier in the file. When a
   data request for a specified target body is made, the segment for that
   target body with highest priority, and whose time interval includes the
   request time, will be selected to satisfy the request.
 
   SPK producers should note that this priority scheme would cause a higher
   priority segment for a target body to mask a lower priority segment for
   the same body over the intersection of the coverage intervals of the two
   segments, if two such segments were written to an SPK file. In
   particular, if an SPK file contained two segments for the same target
   body and time interval, where the segments had different central bodies,
   the lower priority segment would be invisible to the SPK system.
 
 
The Comment Area
 
   Preceding the `segments', the Comment Area provides space in the SPK
   file for storing textual information besides what is written in the
   array names. Ideally, each SPK file would contain internal documentation
   that describes the origin, recommended use, and any other pertinent
   information about the data in that file. For example, the beginning and
   ending epochs for the file, the names and NAIF integer codes of the
   bodies included, an accuracy estimate, the date the file was produced,
   and the names of the source files used in making the SPK file could be
   included in the Comment Area.
 
   The utility programs COMMNT and SPACIT may be used to examine and
   manipulate the comments in an SPK file. In addition to these utilities,
   SPICELIB provides a family of subroutines for handling this Comment
   Area. The name of each routine in this family begins with the letters
   `SPC' which stand for `SPk and Ck' because this feature is common to
   both types of files. The SPC software provides the ability to add,
   extract, read, and delete comments and convert commented files from
   binary format to SPICE transfer format and back to binary again.
 
   The SPC routines and their functions are described in detail in the SPC
   Required Reading, spc.req.
 
 
SPK Data Types
 
   The fourth integer component of the descriptor---the code for the
   representation, or `data type'---is the key to the SPK format.
 
   For purposes of determining the segment best suited to fulfill a
   particular request, all segments are treated equally. It is only when
   the data in a segment are to be evaluated---when a state vector is to be
   computed---that the type of data used to represent the ephemeris becomes
   important.
 
   Because this step is isolated within a single low-level reader, SPKPVN,
   new data types can be added to the SPK format without affecting
   application programs that use the higher level readers. SPKPVN is
   designed so that the changes required to implement a new data type are
   minimal.
 
   There are no real limits on the possible representations that can be
   used for ephemeris data. Users with access to data suitable for creating
   an ephemeris may choose to invent their own representations, adapting
   SPKPVN accordingly. (We recommend that you consult with NAIF prior to
   implementing an new data type.)
 
   The data types currently supported by SPICELIB software are listed under
   ``Supported Data Types'' later in this document.
 
 
Primitive States
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   At the lowest level, it is possible to compute states without combining
   them at all. Given the handle and descriptor for a particular segment,
   subroutine SPKPVN returns a state from that segment directly.
 
      CALL SPKPVN( <handle>,
                   <descr>,
                   <et>,
                   REF,
                   STATE,
                   CENTER   )  { Position, velocity, native frame }
 
   SPKPVN is the most basic SPK reader. It returns states relative to the
   frame in which they are stored in the SPK file. It does not rotate or
   combine them: it returns a state relative to the center whose integer
   code is stored in the descriptor for the segment. This state is relative
   to the frame whose integer ID code is also stored in the descriptor of
   the segment. The user is responsible for using that state correctly.
 
   The user is also responsible for using DAF subroutines to determine the
   particular file and segment from which each state is to be computed.
 
   Note that to use the state returned by SPKPVN in any frame other than
   the ``native frame'' of the segment, you must convert the state to the
   frame of interest.
 
   A second low level routine SPKPV can be used to perform the state
   transformations for you. The calling sequence for SPKPV is identical to
   that for SPKPVN. However, in the case of SPKPV the reference frame is an
   input instead of an output argument.
 
      CALL SPKPV ( <handle>,
                   <descr>,
                   <et>,
                   <ref>,
                   STATE,
                   CENTER   )  { Position, velocity }
 
   Thus using SPKPV instead of SPKPVN allows you to avoid the details of
   converting states to the frame of interest.
 
   If files have been loaded by previous calls to FURNSH, it is possible to
   use the same segments that would normally be used by SPKEZR, SPKEZ,
   SPKSSB, and SPKGEO. Subroutine SPKSFS selects, from the database of
   loaded files, the file handle and segment descriptor for the segment
   best suited to the request. If two segments from different files are
   suitable, SPKSFS selects the one from the file that was loaded later. If
   two segments from the same file are suitable, SPKSFS selects the one
   that is stored later in the file. The call
 
      CALL SPKSFS ( <801>,
                    <et>,
                    HANDLE,
                    DESCR,
                    SEGNAM,
                    FOUND )     { Select file and segment }
 
   returns the handle, descriptor, and segment name for the latest segment
   containing data for Triton at the specified epoch. SPKSFS maintains a
   buffer of segment descriptors and segment names, so it doesn't waste
   time searching the database for bodies it already knows about.
 
 
Examples of Using SPK Readers
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Example 1: Computing Latitude and Longitude
 
   The next several sections present sample programs to show how the SPK
   readers can be used to compute state vectors, and how those vectors can
   be used to compute derived quantities.
 
   All subroutines and functions used in the examples are from SPICELIB.
   The convention of expanding SPK subroutine names will be dropped for
   these examples.
 
   The first example program computes the planetocentric latitude and
   longitude of the sub-observer point on a target body for any combination
   of observer, target, and epoch. (Note that planetocentric coordinates
   differ from planetographic and cartographic coordinates in that they are
   always right-handed, regardless of the rotation of the body. Also note
   that for this example we define the sub-observer point to be the point
   on the ``surface'' of the target that lies on the ray from the center of
   the target to the observer. )

Example 2: Faster Latitude and Longitude
 
   The second example computes the same quantities as the first. However,
   this program assumes that the observer is always the Magellan spacecraft
   and the target is always Venus. It also ignores light-time from the
   planet to the spacecraft. These restrictions allow a more primitive
   reader, SPKPV, to be substituted for the more general reader, SPKEZR.
 
   SPKPV returns this same state as SPKEZR, but avoids much of the overhead
   associated with SPKEZR---making the second program somewhat faster than
   the first.
 
   However, the second program is much less flexible. For example, if the
   spacecraft ephemeris contains cruise data (describing the motion of the
   spacecraft relative to the solar system barycenter instead of the planet
   center), the program would produce incorrect results.
 
   Furthermore, the program cannot easily be generalized to work for other
   orbiters. The motion of the Galileo spacecraft, for instance, would
   normally be known relative to the Jupiter barycenter, not to the planet
   itself.

Example 3: Occultation or Transit
 
   The third example determines epochs if one target body (spacecraft,
   planet, or satellite) is occulted by or in transit across another target
   body as seen from an observer at a user specified epoch. It is similar
   in both form and generality to the first example.

Supported Data Types
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The following representations, or data types, are currently supported by
   the SPK routines in SPICELIB.
 
       1.   Modified Difference Arrays.
 
            Created by the JPL Orbit Determination Program (ODP), these are
            used primarily for spacecraft ephemerides.
 
       2.   Chebyshev polynomials (position only).
 
            These are sets of coefficients for the x, y, and z components
            of the body position. The velocity of the body is obtained by
            differentiation. This data type is normally used for planet
            barycenters, and for satellites whose orbits are integrated.
 
       3.   Chebyshev polynomials (position and velocity).
 
            These are sets of coefficients for the x, y, and z components
            of the body position, and for the corresponding components of
            the velocity. This data type is normally used for satellites
            whose orbits are computed directly from theories.
 
       4.   Reserved for future use (TRW elements for TDRS and Space
            Telescope).
 
       5.   Discrete states (two body propagation).
 
            This data type contains discrete state vectors. A state is
            obtained for a specified epoch by propagating the state vectors
            to that epoch according to the laws of two body motion and then
            taking a weighted average of the resulting states. Normally,
            this data type is used for comets and asteroids, whose
            ephemerides are integrated from an initial state or set of
            osculating elements.
 
       6.   Reserved for future use (Analytic Model for Phobos and Deimos).
 
       7.   Reserved for future use (Precessing Classical Elements---used
            by STScI).
 
       8.   Equally spaced discrete states (Lagrange interpolation)
 
            This data type contains discrete state vectors whose time tags
            are separated by a constant step size. A state is obtained for
            a specified epoch by finding a set of states `centered' at that
            epoch and using Lagrange interpolation on each component of the
            states.
 
       9.   Unequally spaced discrete states (Lagrange interpolation)
 
            This data type contains discrete state vectors whose time tags
            may be unequally spaced. A state is obtained for a specified
            epoch by finding a set of states `centered' at that epoch and
            using Lagrange interpolation on each component of the states.
 
      10.   Space Command Two-line Elements (Short Period Orbits)
 
            This data type contains Space Command two-line element
            representations for objects in Earth orbit (formally called
            NORAD two-line elements).
 
      11.   Reserved for future use.
 
      12.   Hermite Interpolation Uniform Spacing.
 
      13.   Hermite Interpolation Non-uniform Spacing.
 
      14.   Chebyshev polynomials non-uniform spacing (position and
            velocity).
 
            This data type contains Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for
            the position and velocity of an object. Unlike SPK Types 2 and
            3, the time intervals to which polynomial coefficient sets
            apply do not have uniform duration.
 
      15.   Precessing conic propagation.
 
            This data type allows for first order precession of the line of
            apsides and regression of the line of nodes due to the effects
            of the J2 coefficient in the harmonic expansion of the
            gravitational potential of an oblate spheroid.
 
      16.   Reserved for future use (Elements for European Space Agency's
            ISO spacecraft).
 
      17.   Equinoctial Elements
 
            This data type represents the motion of an object about another
            using equinoctial elements. It provides for precession of the
            line of apsides and regression of the line of nodes. Unlike
            Type 15, the mean motion, regression of the nodes and
            precession of the line of apsides are not derived from the
            gravitational properties of the central body, but are empirical
            values.
 
      18.   ESOC/DDID Hermite/Lagrange Interpolation
 
            This data type has been provided to support accurate
            duplication within the SPK system of spacecraft ephemerides
            used by the European Space Agency (ESA) on the Mars Express,
            Rosetta, SMART-1, and Venus express missions.
 
      19.   ESOC/DDID Piecewise Interpolation
 
            SPK type 19 is an enhanced version of SPK type 18. Type 19
            enables creation of SPK files representing the same ephemerides
            that can be represented using type 18, but containing far fewer
            segments. Data from multiple type 18 segments can be stored in
            a single type 19 segment.
 
      20.   Chebyshev (velocity only)
 
            SPK data type 20 contains Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for
            the velocity of a body, relative to its center of motion, as a
            function of time. The position of the body is obtained by
            integrating the velocity using a specified integration
            constant. This data type is provided to accurately represent
            ``EPM'' ephemerides developed by the Institute of Applied

      21.   Extended Modified Difference Arrays
 
            SPK data type 21 contains extended Modified Difference Arrays
            (MDA), also called ``difference lines.'' These data structures
            use the same mathematical trajectory representation as SPK data
            type 1, but type 21 allows use of larger, higher-degree MDAs.
 
   Because SPK files are Double Precision Array Files (DAFs), each segment
   is stored as an array. Each array corresponding to a particular data
   type has a particular internal structure. These structures (for the
   non-reserved types) are described below.
 
 
Type 1: Modified Difference Arrays
 
   The first SPK data type contains Modified Difference Arrays (MDA),
   sometimes called `difference lines'. This data type is normally used for
   spacecraft whose ephemerides are produced by JPL's principal trajectory
   integrator---DPTRAJ. Difference lines are extracted from the spacecraft
   trajectory file (`P-files' and `PV-files') created by DPTRAJ.
 
   Each segment containing Modified Difference Arrays contains an arbitrary
   number of logical records. Each record contains difference line
   coefficients valid up to some final epoch, along with the state at that
   epoch. The contents of the records themselves are described in [163].
   The subroutine SPKE01 contains the algorithm used to construct a state
   from a particular record and epoch.
 
   The records within a segment are ordered by increasing final epoch. The
   final epochs associated with the records must be distinct.
 
   A segment of this type is structured as follows:
 
      +-----------------------------------------+
      | Record 1 (difference line coefficients) |
      +-----------------------------------------+
      | Record 2 (difference line coefficients) |
      +-----------------------------------------+
        .
        .
        .
      +-----------------------------------------+
      | Record N (difference line coefficients) |
      +-----------------------------------------+
      | Epoch 1                      |
      +------------------------------+
      | Epoch 2                      |
      +------------------------------+
        .
        .
        .
      +------------------------------+
      | Epoch N                      |
      +------------------------------+
      | Epoch 100                    |   (First directory epoch)
      +------------------------------+
      | Epoch 200                    |   (Second directory epoch)
      +------------------------------+
        .
        .
        .
      +------------------------------+
      | Epoch (N/100)*100            |   (Final directory epoch)
      +------------------------------+
      | N                            |
      +------------------------------+
 
   The number of records in a segment, N, can be arbitrarily large.
 
   Records 1 through N contain the difference line coefficients and other
   constants needed to compute state data. Each one of these records
   contains 71 double precision numbers.
 
   The list of final epochs for the records is stored immediately after the
   last record.
 
   Following the list of epochs is a second list, the `directory',
   containing every 100th epoch from the previous list. If there are N
   epochs, there will be N/100 directory epochs. If there are fewer than
   100 epochs, then the segment will not contain any directory epochs.
   Directory epochs are used to speed up access to desired records.
 
   The final element in the segment is the number of records contained in
   the segment, N.
 
   The index of the record corresponding to a particular epoch is the index
   of the first epoch not less than the target epoch.
 
 
Type 2: Chebyshev (position only)
 
   The second SPK data type contains Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for
   the position of the body as a function of time. Normally, this data type
   is used for planet barycenters, and for satellites whose ephemerides are
   integrated. (The velocity of the body is obtained by differentiating the
   position.)
 
   Each segment contains an arbitrary number of logical records. Each
   record contains a set of Chebyshev coefficients valid throughout an
   interval of fixed length. The subroutine SPKE02 contains the algorithm
   used to construct a state from a particular record and epoch.
 
   The records within a segment are ordered by increasing initial epoch.
   All records contain the same number of coefficients. A segment of this
   type is structured as follows:
 
      +---------------+
      | Record 1      |
      +---------------+
      | Record 2      |
      +---------------+
        .
        .
        .
      +---------------+
      | Record N      |
      +---------------+
      | INIT          |
      +---------------+
      | INTLEN        |
      +---------------+
      | RSIZE         |
      +---------------+
      | N             |
      +---------------+
 
   A four-number `directory' at the end of the segment contains the
   information needed to determine the location of the record corresponding
   to a particular epoch.
 
       1.   INIT is the initial epoch of the first record, given in
            ephemeris seconds past J2000.
 
       2.   INTLEN is the length of the interval covered by each record, in
            seconds.
 
       3.   RSIZE is the total size of (number of array elements in) each
            record.
 
       4.   N is the number of records contained in the segment.
 
   Each record is structured as follows:
 
      +------------------+
      | MID              |
      +------------------+
      | RADIUS           |
      +------------------+
      | X  coefficients  |
      +------------------+
      | Y  coefficients  |
      +------------------+
      | Z  coefficients  |
      +------------------+
 
   The first two elements in the record, MID and RADIUS, are the midpoint
   and radius of the time interval covered by coefficients in the record.
   These are used as parameters to perform transformations between the
   domain of the record (from MID - RADIUS to MID + RADIUS) and the domain
   of Chebyshev polynomials (from -1 to 1 ).
 
   The same number of coefficients is always used for each component, and
   all records are the same size (RSIZE), so the degree of each polynomial
   is
 
      ( RSIZE - 2 ) / 3 - 1
 
   To facilitate the creation of Type 2 segments, a segment writing routine
   called SPKW02 has been provided. This routine takes as input arguments
   the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the information
   needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to be stored in
   the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a complete
   description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 3: Chebyshev (position and velocity)
 
   The third SPK data type contains Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for
   the position and velocity of the body as a function of time. Normally,
   this data type is used for satellites for which the ephemerides are
   computed from analytical theories.
 
   The structure of the segment is nearly identical to that of the SPK data
   Type 2 (Chebyshev polynomials for position only). The only difference is
   that each logical record contains six sets of coefficients instead of
   three. The subroutine SPKE03 contains the algorithm used to construct a
   state from a particular record and epoch.
 
   Each record is structured as follows:
 
      +------------------+
      | MID              |
      +------------------+
      | RADIUS           |
      +------------------+
      | X  coefficients  |
      +------------------+
      | Y  coefficients  |
      +------------------+
      | Z  coefficients  |
      +------------------+
      | X' coefficients  |
      +------------------+
      | Y' coefficients  |
      +------------------+
      | Z' coefficients  |
      +------------------+
 
   The same number of coefficients is always used for each component, and
   all records are the same size (RSIZE), so the degree of each polynomial
   is
 
      ( RSIZE - 2 ) / 6 - 1
 
   To facilitate the creation of Type 3 segments, a segment writing routine
   called SPKW03 has been provided. This routine takes as input arguments
   the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the information
   needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to be stored in
   the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a complete
   description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 5: Discrete states (two body propagation)
 
   The fifth standard SPK data type contains discrete state vectors. A
   state is obtained from a Type 5 segment for any epoch that is within the
   bounds of that segment by propagating the discrete states to the
   specified epoch according to the laws of two body motion. Normally, this
   data type is used for comets and asteroids, whose ephemerides are
   integrated from an initial state or set of osculating elements.
 
   Each segment contains of a number of logical records. Each record
   consists of an epoch (ephemeris seconds past J2000) and the geometric
   state of the body at that epoch (x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, in
   kilometers and kilometers per second). Records are ordered with respect
   to increasing time.
 
   The records that correspond to an epoch for which a state is desired are
   the ones whose associated epochs bracket that epoch. The state in each
   record is used as the initial state in a two-body propagation; a
   weighted average of the propagated states gives the position of the body
   at the specified epoch. The velocity is given by the derivative of the
   position. Thus the position and velocity at the specified epoch are
   given by:
 
      P  = W(t) * P1(t) + (1-W(t)) * P2(t)
 
      V  = W(t) * V1(t) + (1-W(t)) * V2(t) + W'(t) * ( P1(t) - P2(t) )
 
   where P1, V1, P2, and V2 are the position and velocity components of the
   propagated states and W is the weighting function.
 
   The weighting function used is:
 
      W(t) = 0.5 + 0.5 * cos [ PI * ( t - t1 ) / ( t2 - t1 ) ]
 
   where t1 and t2 are the epochs that bracket the specified epoch t.
 
   Physically, the epochs and states are stored separately, so that the
   epochs can be searched as an ordered array. Thus, the initial part of
   each segment looks like this:
 
      +--------------------+
      | State 1            |
      +--------------------+
               .
               .
               .
      +--------------------+
      | State N            |
      +--------------------+
      | Epoch 1            |
      +--------------------+
               .
               .
               .
      +--------------------+
      | Epoch N            |
      +--------------------+
 
   The number of records in a segment can be arbitrarily large. In order to
   avoid the file reads required to search through a large array of epochs,
   each segment contains a simple directory immediately after the final
   epoch.
 
   This directory contains every 100th epoch in the epoch array. If there
   are N epochs, there will be N/100 directory epochs. (If there are fewer
   than 100 epochs, no directory epochs are stored.)
 
   The final items in the segment are GM, the gravitational parameter of
   the central body (kilometers and seconds), and N, the number of states
   in the segment. Thus, the complete segment looks like this:
 
      +--------------------+
      | State 1            |
      +--------------------+
               .
               .
               .
      +--------------------+
      | Epoch 1            |
      +--------------------+
               .
               .
               .
      +--------------------+
      | Epoch N            |
      +--------------------+
      | Epoch 100          |           (First directory epoch)
      +--------------------+
      | Epoch 200          |
      +--------------------+
               .
               .
               .
      +--------------------+
      | Epoch (N/100)*100  |           (Final directory epoch)
      +--------------------+
      | GM                 |
      +--------------------+
      | N                  |
      +--------------------+
 
   To facilitate the creation of Type 5 segments, a segment writing routine
   called SPKW05 has been provided. This routine takes as input arguments
   the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the information
   needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to be stored in
   the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a complete
   description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 8: Lagrange Interpolation --- Equal Time Steps
 
   The eighth SPK data type represents a continuous ephemeris using a
   discrete set of states and a Lagrange interpolation method. The epochs
   (also called `time tags') associated with the states must be evenly
   spaced: there must be some positive constant STEP such that each time
   tag differs from its predecessor and successor by STEP seconds. For a
   request epoch not corresponding to the time tag of some state, the data
   type defines a state by interpolating each component of a set of states
   whose epochs are `centered' near the request epoch. Details of how these
   states are selected and interpolated are given below.
 
   The SPK system can also represent an ephemeris using unequally spaced
   discrete states and Lagrange interpolation; SPK Type 9 does this. SPK
   Type 9 sacrifices some run-time speed and economy of storage in order to
   achieve greater flexibility.
 
   The states in a Type 8 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The six components of each state vector
   represent the position and velocity (x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, in
   kilometers and kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris
   applies, relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor.
   The epochs corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times
   (TDB), expressed as seconds past J2000.
 
   Each segment also has a polynomial degree associated with it; this is
   the degree of the interpolating polynomials to be used in evaluating
   states based on the data in the segment. The identical degree is used
   for interpolation of each state component.
 
   Type 8 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
 
                                          +--------+
                                          |  x(1)  |
                                      /   +--------+
                                     /    |  y(1)  |
                                    /     +--------+
                                   /      |  z(1)  |
      +-----------------------+   /       +--------+
      | State 1               |  <        |dx(1)/dt|
      +-----------------------+   \       +--------+
      | State 2               |    \      |dy(1)/dt|
      +-----------------------+     \     +--------+
                  .                  \    |dz(1)/dt|
                  .                       +--------+
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | State N               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch of state 1 (TDB)|
      +-----------------------+
      | Step size             |
      +-----------------------+
      | Polynomial degree     |
      +-----------------------+
      | Number of states      |
      +-----------------------+
 
   In the diagram, each box representing a state vector corresponds to six
   double precision numbers; the other boxes represent individual double
   precision numbers. Since the epochs of the states are evenly spaced,
   they are represented by a start epoch and a step size. The number of
   states must be greater than the interpolating polynomial degree.
 
   The Type 8 interpolation method works as follows: given an epoch at
   which a state is requested and a segment having coverage for that epoch,
   the Type 8 reader finds a group of states whose epochs are `centered'
   about the epoch. The size of the group is one greater than the
   polynomial degree associated with the segment. If the group size N is
   even, then the group will consist of N consecutive states such that the
   request time is between the epochs of the members of the group having
   indices, relative to the start of the group, of N/2 and (N/2 + 1),
   inclusive. When N is odd, the group will contain a central state whose
   epoch is closest to the request time, and will also contain (N-1)/2
   neighboring states on either side of the central one. The Type 8
   evaluator will then use Lagrange interpolation on each component of the
   states to produce a state corresponding to the request time. For the jth
   state component, the interpolation algorithm is mathematically
   equivalent to finding the unique polynomial of degree N-1 that
   interpolates the ordered pairs
 
      ( epoch(i), state(j,i) ),  i = k ,  k , ... , k
                                      1    2         N
 
   and evaluating the polynomial at the requested epoch. Here
 
       k ,  k , ... , k
        1    2         N
 
   are the indices of the states in the interpolation group,
 
      epoch(i)
 
   is the epoch of the ith state and
 
      state(j,i)
 
   is the jth component of the ith state.
 
   There is an exception to the state selection algorithm described above:
   the request time may be too near the first or last state of the segment
   to be properly bracketed. In this case, the set of states selected for
   interpolation still has size N, and includes either the first or last
   state of the segment.
 
   To facilitate the creation of Type 8 segments, a segment writing routine
   called SPKW08 has been provided. This routine takes as input arguments
   the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the information
   needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to be stored in
   the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a complete
   description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 9: Lagrange Interpolation --- Unequal Time Steps
 
   The ninth SPK data type represents a continuous ephemeris using a
   discrete set of states and a Lagrange interpolation method. The epochs
   (also called `time tags') associated with the states need not be evenly
   spaced. For a request epoch not corresponding to the time tag of some
   state, the data type defines a state by interpolating each component of
   a set of states whose epochs are `centered' near the request epoch.
   Details of how these states are selected and interpolated are given
   below.
 
   The states in a Type 9 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The six components of each state vector
   represent the position and velocity (x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, in
   kilometers and kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris
   applies, relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor.
   The epochs corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times
   (TDB), expressed as seconds past J2000.
 
   Each segment also has a polynomial degree associated with it; this is
   the degree of the interpolating polynomials to be used in evaluating
   states based on the data in the segment. The identical degree is used
   for interpolation of each state component.
 
   Type 9 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
 
                                          +--------+
                                          |  x(1)  |
                                      /   +--------+
                                     /    |  y(1)  |
                                    /     +--------+
                                   /      |  z(1)  |
      +-----------------------+   /       +--------+
      | State 1               |  <        |dx(1)/dt|
      +-----------------------+   \       +--------+
      | State 2               |    \      |dy(1)/dt|
      +-----------------------+     \     +--------+
                  .                  \    |dz(1)/dt|
                  .                       +--------+
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | State N               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 1               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 2               |
      +-----------------------+
                  .
                  .
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch N               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 100             | (First directory)
      +-----------------------+
                  .
                  .
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch ((N-1)/100)*100 | (Last directory)
      +-----------------------+
      | Polynomial degree     |
      +-----------------------+
      | Number of states      |
      +-----------------------+
 
 
   In the diagram, each box representing a state vector corresponds to six
   double precision numbers; the other boxes represent individual double
   precision numbers. The number of states must be greater than the
   interpolating polynomial degree.
 
   The set of time tags is augmented by a series of directory entries;
   these entries allow the Type 9 reader to search for states more
   efficiently. The directory entries contain time tags whose indices are
   multiples of 100. The set of indices of time tags stored in the
   directories ranges from 100 to
 
      (  (N-1) / 100  ) * 100
 
   where N is the total number of time tags. Note that if N is
 
      Q * 100
 
   then only
 
      Q - 1
 
   directory entries are stored, and in particular, if there are only 100
   states in the segment, there are no directories.
 
   The Type 9 interpolation algorithm is virtually identical to the Type 8
   algorithm; see the discussion of SPK Type 8 for details. However, the
   Type 9 algorithm executes more slowly than the Type 8 algorithm, since
   the Type 9 reader must search through tables of time tags to find
   appropriates states to interpolate, while the Type 8 reader can locate
   the correct set of states to interpolate by a direct computation.
 
   To facilitate the creation of Type 9 segments, a segment writing routine
   called SPKW09 has been provided. This routine takes as input arguments
   the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the information
   needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to be stored in
   the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a complete
   description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 10: Space Command Two-Line Elements
 
   The SPK data Type 10 uses the SPICE concept of a generic segment to
   store a collection of packets each of which models the trajectory of
   some Earth satellite using Space Command two-line element sets (TLEs)
   (formerly the North American Air Defense --- NORAD). TLE propagation
   occurs using the algorithms as described in the Spacetrak 3 report for
   SGP4 and SDP4. Note: The Spacetrak 3 implementation of SDP4 contained
   several programming errors. The errors were corrected for SPICE
   implementation.
 
   The SPICE generic segment software handles storage, arrangement, and
   retrieval of the TLEs. We review only the pertinent points about generic
   segments here.
 
   A generic SPK segment contains several logical data partitions:
 
       1.   A partition for constant values to be associated with each data
            packet in the segment.
 
       2.   A partition for the data packets.
 
       3.   A partition for epochs.
 
       4.   A partition for a packet directory, if the segment contains
            variable sized packets.
 
       5.   A partition for an epoch directory.
 
       6.   A reserved partition that is not currently used. This partition
            is only for the use of the NAIF group at the Jet Propulsion
            Laboratory (JPL).
 
       7.   A partition for the meta data which describes the locations and
            sizes of other partitions as well as providing some additional
            descriptive information about the generic segment.

   The reference epochs partition contains an ordered collection of epochs.
   The i'th reference epoch is equal to the epoch in the i'th packet.
 
   The ``epoch directory'' contains every 100th reference epoch. The epoch
   directory is used to efficiently locate an the reference epoch that
   should be associated with a two line element packet.
 
   The ``packet directory'' is empty.
 
   Access to the data should be made via the SPK Type 10 reader---SPKR10 or
   via the SPICELIB generic segment routines. Use the routine SPKW10 to
   write a Type 10 generic segment.
 
 
Type 12: Hermite Interpolation --- Equal Time Steps
 
   The twelfth SPK data type represents a continuous ephemeris using a
   discrete set of states and a sliding window Hermite interpolation
   method. The epochs, also called "time tags," associated with the states
   must be evenly spaced: there must be some positive constant STEP such
   that each time tag differs from its predecessor by STEP seconds. For any
   request epoch, the data type defines a state by interpolating a set of
   consecutive states, or "window," centered as closely as possible to the
   request epoch. Interpolated position values are obtained for each
   coordinate by fitting a Hermite polynomial to the window's set of
   position and velocity values for that coordinate; interpolated velocity
   is obtained by differentiating the interpolating polynomials. Details of
   the interpolation method are given below.
 
   The SPK system can also represent an ephemeris using unequally spaced
   discrete states and Hermite interpolation; SPK type 13 does this. SPK
   type 13 sacrifices some run-time speed and economy of storage in order
   to achieve greater flexibility.
 
   The states in a type 12 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The six components of each state vector
   represent the position and velocity (x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, in
   kilometers and kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris
   applies, relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor.
   The epochs corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times
   (TDB), expressed as seconds past J2000.
 
   Each segment also has a polynomial degree associated with it; this is
   the degree of the interpolating polynomials to be used in evaluating
   states based on the data in the segment. The identical degree is used
   for interpolation of each state component.
 
   Type 12 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
 
                                          +--------+
                                          |  x(1)  |
                                      /   +--------+
                                     /    |  y(1)  |
                                    /     +--------+
                                   /      |  z(1)  |
      +-----------------------+   /       +--------+
      | State 1               |  <        |dx(1)/dt|
      +-----------------------+   \       +--------+
      | State 2               |    \      |dy(1)/dt|
      +-----------------------+     \     +--------+
                  .                  \    |dz(1)/dt|
                  .                       +--------+
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | State N               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch of state 1 (TDB)|
      +-----------------------+
      | Step size             |
      +-----------------------+
      | Window size - 1       |
      +-----------------------+
      | Number of states      |
      +-----------------------+
 
   In the diagram, each box representing a state vector corresponds to six
   double precision numbers; the other boxes represent individual double
   precision numbers. Since the epochs of the states are evenly spaced,
   they are represented by a start epoch and a step size. The number of
   states must be greater than or equal to the window size, which is
   related to the polynomial degree as shown:
 
      DEGREE  =  2 * WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
 
   The type 12 interpolation method works as follows: given an epoch at
   which a state is requested and a segment having coverage for that epoch,
   the type 12 reader finds a window of states whose epochs are "centered"
   about the epoch. If the window size S is even, then the window will
   consist of S consecutive states such that the request time is between
   the epochs of the members of the group having indices, relative to the
   start of the group, of S/2 and (S/2 + 1), inclusive. When S is odd, the
   group will contain a central state whose epoch is closest to the request
   time, and will also contain (S-1)/2 neighboring states on either side of
   the central one. For each of the x-, y-, and z-coordinates, the type 12
   evaluator will fit an Hermite polynomial to the corresponding position
   and velocity values of the states in the selected window. Each
   polynomial is evaluated at the request time to yield the interpolated
   position components. The derivatives of these polynomials are evaluated
   at the request time to yield the interpolated velocity components.
 
   For the jth coordinate, the interpolation algorithm is mathematically
   equivalent to finding the unique polynomial of degree 2*S-1 that
   interpolates the ordered pairs
 
      ( epoch(i), position(j,i) ),  i = k ,  k , ... , k
                                         1    2         S
 
   and whose derivative interpolates the ordered pairs
 
      ( epoch(i), velocity(j,i) ),  i = k ,  k , ... , k
                                         1    2         S
 
   and evaluating the polynomial and its derivative at the requested epoch.
   Here
 
       k ,  k , ... , k
        1    2         S
 
   are the indices of the states in the interpolation window,
 
      epoch(i)
 
   is the epoch of the ith state and
 
      position(j,i)
      velocity(j,i)
 
   are, respectively, the jth components of the position and velocity
   comprising the ith state.
 
   There is an exception to the state selection algorithm described above:
   the request time may be too near the first or last state of the segment
   to be properly bracketed. In this case, the set of states selected for
   interpolation still has size S, and includes either the first or last
   state of the segment.
 
   To facilitate the creation of type 12 segments, a segment writing
   routine called SPKW12 has been provided. This routine takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a
   complete description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 13: Hermite Interpolation --- Unequal Time Steps
 
   The thirteenth SPK data type represents a continuous ephemeris using a
   discrete set of states and a sliding window Hermite interpolation
   method. The epochs, also called "time tags," associated with the states
   need not be evenly spaced. For any request epoch, the data type defines
   a state by interpolating a set of consecutive states, or "window,"
   centered as closely as possible to the request epoch. Interpolated
   position values are obtained for each coordinate by fitting a Hermite
   polynomial to the window's set of position and velocity values for that
   coordinate; interpolated velocity is obtained by differentiating the
   interpolating polynomials. Details of the interpolation method are given
   below.
 
   The states in a type 13 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The six components of each state vector
   represent the position and velocity (x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, in
   kilometers and kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris
   applies, relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor.
   The epochs corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times
   (TDB), expressed as seconds past J2000.
 
   Each segment also has a polynomial degree associated with it; this is
   the degree of the interpolating polynomials to be used in evaluating
   states based on the data in the segment. The identical degree is used
   for interpolation of each state component.
 
   Type 13 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
 
                                          +--------+
                                          |  x(1)  |
                                      /   +--------+
                                     /    |  y(1)  |
                                    /     +--------+
                                   /      |  z(1)  |
      +-----------------------+   /       +--------+
      | State 1               |  <        |dx(1)/dt|
      +-----------------------+   \       +--------+
      | State 2               |    \      |dy(1)/dt|
      +-----------------------+     \     +--------+
                  .                  \    |dz(1)/dt|
                  .                       +--------+
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | State N               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 1               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 2               |
      +-----------------------+
                  .
                  .
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch N               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 100             | (First directory)
      +-----------------------+
                  .
                  .
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch ((N-1)/100)*100 | (Last directory)
      +-----------------------+
      | Window size - 1       |
      +-----------------------+
      | Number of states      |
      +-----------------------+
 
 
   In the diagram, each box representing a state vector corresponds to six
   double precision numbers; the other boxes represent individual double
   precision numbers. The number of states must be greater than or equal to
   the window size, which is related to the polynomial degree as shown:
 
      DEGREE  =  2 * WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
 
   The set of time tags is augmented by a series of directory entries;
   these entries allow the type 13 reader to search for states more
   efficiently. The directory entries contain time tags whose indices are
   multiples of 100. The set of indices of time tags stored in the
   directories ranges from 100 to
 
      (  (N-1) / 100  ) * 100
 
   where N is the total number of time tags. Note that if N is
 
      Q * 100
 
   then only
 
      Q - 1
 
   directory entries are stored, and in particular, if there are only 100
   states in the segment, there are no directories.
 
   The type 13 interpolation algorithm is virtually identical to the type
   12 algorithm; see the discussion of SPK type 12 for details. However,
   the type 13 algorithm executes more slowly than the type 12 algorithm,
   since the type 13 reader must search through tables of time tags to find
   appropriates states to interpolate, while the type 12 reader can locate
   the correct set of states to interpolate by a direct computation.
 
   To facilitate the creation of type 13 segments, a segment writing
   routine called SPKW13 has been provided. This routine takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a
   complete description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 14: Chebyshev Polynomials --- Unequal Time Steps
 
   The SPK data Type 14 uses the SPICE concept of a generic segment to
   store a collection of packets each of which models the trajectory of
   some object with respect to another over some interval of time. Each
   packet contains a set of coefficients for Chebyshev polynomials that
   approximate the position and velocity of some object. The time intervals
   corresponding to each packet are non-overlapping. Moreover their union
   covers the interval of time spanned by the start and end times of the
   Type 14 segment. Unlike Types 2 and 3 the time spacing between sets of
   coefficients for a Type 14 segment may be non-uniform.
 
   The storage, arrangement and retrieval of packets is handled by the
   SPICE generic segment software. That software is documented in the
   document genseg.req. (The document genseg.req is currently in
   preparation.) We only review the pertinent points about generic segments
   here.
 
   A generic SPK segment contains several logical data partitions:
 
       1.   A partition for constant values to be associated with each data
            packet in the segment.
 
       2.   A partition for the data packets.
 
       3.   A partition for epochs.
 
       4.   A partition for a packet directory, if the segment contains
            variable sized packets.
 
       5.   A partition for an epoch directory.
 
       6.   A reserved partition that is not currently used. This partition
            is only for the use of the NAIF group at the Jet Propulsion
            Laboratory (JPL).
 
       7.   A partition for the meta data which describes the locations and
            sizes of other partitions as well as providing some additional
            descriptive information about the generic segment.

         |     Segment Meta Data      |
         +----------------------------+
 
   Only the placement of the meta data at the end of a generic segment is
   required. The other data partitions may occur in any order in the
   generic segment because the meta data will contain pointers to their
   appropriate locations within the generic segment.
 
   In the case of Type 14 SPK segments each ``packet'' contains an epoch,
   EPOCH, an allowed time offset, OFFSET, from the epoch, and 6 sets of
   Chebyshev polynomial coefficients which are used to evaluate the x,y,z,
   dx/dt, dy/dt, and dz/dt components of the state for epochs within OFFSET
   seconds of the EPOCH. Each packet is organized with the following
   structure:
 
      ------------------------------------------------
      |  The midpoint of the approximation interval  |
      ------------------------------------------------
      |  The radius of the approximation interval    |

   The maximum degree Chebyshev representation that can currently be
   accommodated is 18. Packets are stored in increasing order of the
   midpoint of the approximation interval.
 
   The ``constants'' partition contains a single value, the degree of the
   Chebyshev representation.
 
   The reference epochs partition contains an ordered collection of epochs.
   The i'th reference epoch corresponds to the beginning of the interval
   for which the i'th packet can be used to determine the state of the
   object modeled by this segment.
 
   The ``epoch directory'' contains every 100th reference epoch. The epoch
   directory is used to efficiently locate an the reference epoch that
   should be associated with an epoch for which a state has been requested.
 
   The ``packet directory'' is empty.
 
   As noted above the exact location of the various partitions must be
   obtained from the Meta data contained at the end of the segment.
 
   Access to the data should be made via the SPICELIB generic segment
   routines.
 
   Type 14 segments should be created using the routines SPK14B, SPK14A,
   and SPK14E. The usage of these routines is discussed in SPK14B.
 
 
Type 15: Precessing Conic Propagation
 
   The SPK data Type 15 represents a continuous ephemeris using a compact
   analytic model. The object is modeled as orbiting a central body under
   the influence of a central mass plus first order secular effects of the
   J2 term in harmonic expansion of the central body gravitational
   potential.
 
   Type 15 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
 
              +--------------------------------+
              | Epoch of Periapsis             |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Trajectory pole_x              |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Trajectory pole_y              |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Trajectory pole_z              |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Periapsis Unit Vector_x        |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Periapsis Unit Vector_y        |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Periapsis Unit Vector_z        |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Semi-Latus Rectum              |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Eccentricity                   |
              +--------------------------------+
              | J2 Processing Flag             |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Central Body Pole_x            |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Central Body Pole_y            |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Central Body Pole_z            |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Central Body GM                |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Central Body J2                |
              +--------------------------------+
              | Central Body Equatorial Radius |
              +--------------------------------+
 
   It is important to note that the epoch must be that of periapsis
   passage. Precession of the line of apsides and regression of the line of
   nodes is computed relative to this epoch.
 
   The effects of the J2 term are not applied if the eccentricity is
   greater than or equal to 1.
 
   To facilitate the creation of Type 15 segments, a segment writing
   routine called SPKW15 has been provided. This routine takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a
   complete description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 17: Equinoctial Elements
 
   The SPK data Type 17 represents a continuous ephemeris using a compact
   analytic model. The object is following an elliptic orbit with
   precessing line of nodes and argument of periapse relative to the
   equatorial frame of some central body. The orbit is modeled via
   equinoctial elements.
 
   Type 17 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
 
                +----------------------------------+
              1 | Epoch of Periapsis               |
                +----------------------------------+
              2 | Semi-Major Axis                  |
                +----------------------------------+
              3 | H term of equinoctial elements   |
                +----------------------------------+
             4  | K term of equinoctial elements   |
                +----------------------------------+
             5  | Mean longitude at epoch          |
                +----------------------------------+
             6  | P term of equinoctial elements   |
                +----------------------------------+
             7  | Q term of equinoctial elements   |
                +----------------------------------+
             8  | rate of longitude of periapse    |
                +----------------------------------+
             9  | mean longitude rate              |
                +----------------------------------+
            10  | longitude of ascending node rate |
                +----------------------------------+
            11  | equatorial pole right ascension  |
                +----------------------------------+
            12  | equatorial pole declination      |
                +----------------------------------+
 
   To facilitate the creation of Type 17 segments, a segment writing
   routine called SPKW17 has been provided. This routine takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a

Type 18: ESOC/DDID Hermite/Lagrange Interpolation
 
   SPK type 18 has been provided to support accurate duplication within the
   SPK system of spacecraft ephemerides used by the European Space Agency
   (ESA) on the Mars Express, Rosetta, SMART-1 and Venus Express missions.
   However, the algorithms used by SPK type 18 are very general; type 18's
   applicability is by no means limited to these missions.
 
   Because of the possibility of evolution of the mathematical
   representations of ephemerides used by ESA, SPK type 18 is designed to
   accommodate multiple representations, thereby avoiding a proliferation
   of SPK data types. SPK type 18 refers to each supported mathematical
   representation of ephemeris data as a ``subtype.''
 
   Currently SPK type 18 supports two subtypes:
 
       1.   Subtype 0
 
            Separate sliding-window Hermite interpolation of position and
            velocity. The ephemeris is represented by a series of
            12-element ``packets'' and associated time tags. The time tags
            may be unequally spaced. Each packet contains three Cartesian
            position components, three velocity components meant to be used
            for Hermite interpolation of the position, three velocity
            components (not necessarily equal to the previous three), and
            three acceleration components meant to be used with the second
            set of velocity components for Hermite interpolation of the
            velocity. The position and velocity resulting from this
            interpolation method are in principle independent. The same
            interpolation degree is used for each position and velocity
            component.
 
       2.   Subtype 1
 
            Separate sliding-window Lagrange interpolation of position and
            velocity. The ephemeris is represented by a series of 6-element
            ``packets'' and associated time tags. The time tags may be
            unequally spaced. Each packet contains three Cartesian position
            components and three velocity components. The position
            components and velocity components are interpolated separately.
            The position and velocity resulting from this interpolation
            method are in principle independent. The same interpolation
            degree is used for each position and velocity component.
 
   The sliding-window interpolation technique used by this data type works
   as follows: for any request epoch, the data type defines a component of
   position or velocity by interpolating a set of values of that component
   defined on a set of consecutive time tags---a "window"---centered as
   closely as possible to the request epoch. The nominal window size is
   dictated by the degree and type (Hermite vs. Lagrange) of the
   interpolating polynomials. Normally the window of time tags has even
   size, and the window is selected so that the request time is located
   between the two central time tags in the window.
 
   When the request time is near a segment boundary, the window is
   truncated if necessary on the side closest to the boundary. If a segment
   contains too few packets to form a window of nominal size, as many
   packets as are needed and available are used to construct the window. In
   this case the window size may be odd. In any case the window never
   includes more than WNDSIZ/2 time tags on either side of the request
   time, where WNDSIZ is the nominal window size.
 
   The states in a type 18 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The position and velocity components of
   each packet represent the position (x, y, z, in kilometers and
   kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris applies,
   relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor. The epochs
   corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times (TDB),
   expressed as seconds past J2000.
 
   Type 18 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
 
      +-----------------------+
      | Packet 1              |
      +-----------------------+
      | Packet 2              |
      +-----------------------+
                  .
                  .
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | Packet N              |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 1               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 2               |
      +-----------------------+
                  .
                  .
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch N               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 100             | (First directory)
      +-----------------------+
                  .
                  .
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch ((N-1)/100)*100 | (Last directory)
      +-----------------------+
      | Subtype code          |
      +-----------------------+
      | Window size           |
      +-----------------------+
      | Number of packets     |
      +-----------------------+
 
 
   In the diagram, each box representing a packet corresponds to either
   twelve or six double precision numbers; the other boxes represent
   individual double precision numbers. The number of states normally
   should be greater than or equal to the window size, which is related to
   the polynomial degree as shown:
 
      Subtype 0:     DEGREE  =  2 * WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
      Subtype 1:     DEGREE  =      WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
 
   The set of time tags is augmented by a series of directory entries;
   these entries allow the type 18 reader to search for states more
   efficiently. The directory entries contain time tags whose indices are
   multiples of 100. The set of indices of time tags stored in the
   directories ranges from 100 to
 
      (  (N-1) / 100  ) * 100
 
   where N is the total number of time tags. Note that if N is
 
      Q * 100
 
   then only
 
      Q - 1
 
   directory entries are stored, and in particular, if there are only 100
   states in the segment, there are no directories.
 
   To facilitate the creation of type 18 segments, a segment writing
   routine called SPKW18 has been provided. This routine takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a
   complete description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 19: ESOC/DDID Piecewise Interpolation
 
   As with SPK type 18, SPK type 19 has been provided to support accurate
   duplication by the SPK system of spacecraft ephemerides used by the
   European Space Agency (ESA) on the Mars Express, Rosetta, SMART-1 and
   Venus Express missions.
 
   SPK type 19 is an enhanced version of SPK type 18. Type 19 enables
   creation of SPK files representing the same ephemerides that can be
   represented using type 18, but containing far fewer segments. Data from
   multiple type 18 segments can be stored in a single type 19 segment, as
   long as those segments satisfy certain restrictions:
 
       --   The segments are for the same body, center, and reference
            frame.
 
       --   The segments' coverage intervals, when arranged in increasing
            time order, overlap only at their endpoints, and have no
            intervening gaps.
 
   Within a type 19 segment, each set of data corresponding to a type 18
   segment is called a ``mini-segment.'' A type 19 segment contains one or
   more mini-segments.
 
   Each mini-segment contains a time ordered, strictly increasing sequence
   of epochs (no two epochs of the same mini-segment may coincide) and an
   associated sequence of ephemeris data sets called ``packets.'' The
   composition of a packet depends on the subtype of the mini-segment to
   which the packet belongs; subtypes are discussed in more detail below.
 
   The time coverage of a mini-segment is called an ``interpolation
   interval.'' The endpoints (boundaries) of each interpolation interval
   must be contained in the time interval bounded by the first and last
   members of the epoch sequence of the corresponding mini-segment. If the
   Ith mini-segment's epoch sequence is
 
      E_I1, ..., E_IM
 
   and the mini-segment's interpolation interval bounds are
 
      IV_IB, IV_IE
 
   then it is required that
 
      E_I1 < IV_IB < IV_IE < E_IM
           -              -
 
   Mini-segments are allowed to contain ``padding'' epochs and packets
   beyond both ends of their interpolation intervals. Padding epochs on the
   left of an interpolation interval are less than the interval start time;
   padding epochs on the right exceed the interval stop time. Padding
   enables control of interpolation behavior at and near interpolation
   interval boundaries. Padding does not contribute to a type 19 segment's
   time coverage. The use of padding is discussed in greater detail below.
 
   The interpolation intervals of a type 19 segment have no intervening
   gaps and overlap only at single points. The end time of each
   interpolation interval is the start time of the next. The start time of
   a type 19 segment is greater than or equal to the start time of the
   first interval, and the segment's end time is less than or equal to the
   stop time of the last interval.
 
   Interpolation intervals must have strictly positive length.
 
   When type 19 data are interpolated to produce a state vector for a given
   request time, only data from a single mini-segment whose interpolation
   interval contains the request time are used.
 
   When a request time coincides with the boundary between two
   interpolation intervals, there is a choice as to which interval will
   provide ephemeris data. The creator of a type 19 segment can control
   this behavior via a parameter passed to the type 19 segment writer
   SPKW19. For a given type 19 segment, depending on the value of this
   parameter, either the earlier interval is always selected, or the later
   interval is always selected.
 
   Because of the possibility of evolution of the mathematical
   representations of ephemerides used by ESA, SPK type 19 is designed to
   accommodate multiple representations of state data, thereby avoiding a
   proliferation of SPK data types. SPK type 19 refers to each supported
   mathematical representation of ephemeris data as a ``subtype.''
 
   Currently SPK type 19 supports two subtypes:
 
       1.   Subtype 0
 
            Separate sliding-window Hermite interpolation of position and
            velocity. The ephemeris is represented by a series of
            12-element ``packets'' and associated time tags. The time tags
            may be unequally spaced. Each packet contains three Cartesian
            position components, three velocity components meant to be used
            for Hermite interpolation of the position, three velocity
            components (not necessarily equal to the previous three), and
            three acceleration components meant to be used with the second
            set of velocity components for Hermite interpolation of the
            velocity. The position and velocity resulting from this
            interpolation method are in principle independent. The same
            interpolation degree is used for each position and velocity
            component.
 
            The interpolation degree of a subtype 0 mini-segment must be
            equivalent to 3 mod 4, that is, it must be in the set
 
               { 3, 7, 11, ..., MAXDEG }
 
            where MAXDEG is the maximum supported degree.
 
       2.   Subtype 1
 
            Separate sliding-window Lagrange interpolation of position and
            velocity. The ephemeris is represented by a series of 6-element
            ``packets'' and associated time tags. The time tags may be
            unequally spaced. Each packet contains three Cartesian position
            components and three velocity components. The position
            components and velocity components are interpolated separately.
            The position and velocity resulting from this interpolation
            method are in principle independent. The same interpolation
            degree is used for each position and velocity component.
 
            The interpolation degree of a subtype 0 mini-segment must be
            odd and must be in the range 1:MAXDEG, where MAXDEG is the
            maximum supported degree.
 
   The sliding-window interpolation technique used by this data type works
   as follows: for any request epoch, the data type's state evaluation code
   computes a component of position or velocity by interpolating a set of
   values of that component defined on a set of consecutive time tags---a
   "window"---centered as closely as possible to the request epoch. The
   nominal window size is dictated by the degree and type (Hermite vs.
   Lagrange) of the interpolating polynomials. Normally the window of time
   tags has even size, and the window is selected so that the request time
   is located between the two central time tags in the window. When the
   request time is too close to an endpoint of the mini-segment's epoch
   sequence to permit construction of a window of nominal size, the window
   is truncated at that endpoint.
 
   Although type 19 interpolation intervals support padding, padding is not
   required. Below we'll discuss the role of padding, but the reader should
   keep in mind that the size of the pads at either end of an interpolation
   interval could be zero.
 
   In SPK type 19, interpolation interval padding boundaries (the start
   time of the padding preceding the interval's coverage and the stop time
   of the padding following the coverage) affect interpolation in the same
   way that segment boundaries affect type 18 interpolation. When the
   request time is near a padding boundary, the window is truncated if
   necessary on the side closest to the boundary. If an interpolation
   interval, including padding, contains too few packets to form a window
   of nominal size, as many packets as are needed and available are used to
   construct the window. In this case the window size may be odd. In any
   case the window never includes more than WNDSIZ/2 time tags on either
   side of the request time, where WNDSIZ is the nominal window size.
 
   The mini-segments of a type 19 segment need not use the same subtypes
   and interpolation degrees.
 
   The states in a type 19 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The position and velocity components of
   each packet represent the position (x, y, z, in kilometers and
   kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris applies,
   relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor. The epochs
   corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times (TDB),
   expressed as seconds past J2000.
 
   Type 19 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
 
      +--------------------------------+
      | Interval 1 mini-segment        |
      +--------------------------------+
                      .
                      .
                      .
      +--------------------------------+
      | Interval N mini-segment        |
      +--------------------------------+
      | Interval 1 start time          |
      +--------------------------------+
                      .
                      .
                      .
      +--------------------------------+
      | Interval N start time          |
      +--------------------------------+
      | Interval N stop time           |
      +--------------------------------+
      | Interval start 100             | (First interval directory)
      +--------------------------------+
                      .
                      .
                      .
      +--------------------------------+
      | Interval start (N/100)*100     | (Last interval directory)
      +--------------------------------+
      | Mini-segment 1 start pointer   |
      +--------------------------------+
                      .
                      .
                      .
      +--------------------------------+
      | Mini-segment N start pointer   |
      +--------------------------------+
      | Mini-segment N stop pointer    |
      +--------------------------------+
      | Boundary choice flag           |
      +--------------------------------+
      | Number of intervals            |
      +--------------------------------+
 
   Below we first describe the overall segment structure, then we cover the
   mini-segment structure.
 
   The array of interval boundaries contains the start time of each
   interval, plus the stop time of the final interval.
 
   The list of interpolation interval boundary times has its own directory,
   which has the same structure as the time tag directories of type 18
   segments. Let the interval count be N. As with time tag directories, the
   start time directory contains boundary times whose indices are multiples
   of 100, except that if N+1 is a multiple of 100, the last boundary time
   is not included.
 
   The array of mini-segment pointers contains a pointer to the start of
   each mini-segment, plus a final ``stop'' pointer for the final
   mini-segment. The stop pointer points to the location immediately
   following the last address of the final mini-segment.
 
   The mini-segment pointers are 1-based indices relative to the start
   address of the segment. For example, a pointer value of 1 indicates the
   first address of the segment.
 
   Following the mini-segment pointers is the interval selection flag. When
   this flag has the value 1.D0, the later interpolation interval is used
   when a request time falls on the common boundary between two
   interpolation intervals. If the selection flag is 0, the earlier
   interval is used.
 
   Each mini-segment has the structure of a type 18 SPK segment. The
   structure is shown below:
 
      +-----------------------+
      | Packet 1              |
      +-----------------------+
                  .
                  .
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | Packet M              |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 1               |
      +-----------------------+
                  .
                  .
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch M               |
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch 100             | (First time tag directory)
      +-----------------------+
                  .
                  .
                  .
      +-----------------------+
      | Epoch ((M-1)/100)*100 | (Last time tag directory)
      +-----------------------+
      | Subtype code          |
      +-----------------------+
      | Window size           |
      +-----------------------+
      | Number of packets     |
      +-----------------------+
 
 
   In the mini-segment diagram, each box representing a packet corresponds
   to either twelve or six double precision numbers; the other boxes
   represent individual double precision numbers. The number of packets
   normally should be greater than or equal to the window size, which is
   related to the polynomial degree as shown:
 
      Subtype 0:     DEGREE  =  2 * WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
      Subtype 1:     DEGREE  =      WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
 
   The mini-segment's set of time tags is augmented by a series of
   directory entries; these entries allow the type 19 reader to search for
   packets more efficiently. The directory entries contain time tags whose
   indices are multiples of 100. The set of indices of time tags stored in
   the directories ranges from 100 to
 
      (  (M-1) / 100  ) * 100
 
   where M is the total number of time tags. Note that if M is
 
      Q * 100
 
   then only
 
      Q - 1
 
   directory entries are stored, and in particular, if there are only 100
   states in the segment, there are no directories.
 
   Following the time tag directory are three parameters associated with
   the mini-segment: the subtype, the interpolation window size, and the
   packet count.
 
   To facilitate the creation of type 19 segments, a segment writing
   routine called SPKW19 has been provided. This routine takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a
   complete description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 20: Chebyshev (velocity only)
 
   SPK data type 20 contains Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for the
   velocity of a body, relative to its center of motion, as a function of
   time. The position of the body is obtained by integrating the velocity
   using a specified integration constant.
 
   This data type is provided to accurately represent ``EPM'' ephemerides
   developed by the Institute of Applied Astronomy (IAA), Russian Academy
   of Sciences (RAS).
 
   Each type 20 segment contains an arbitrary number of logical records.
   Each record contains a set of Chebyshev coefficients valid throughout an
   interval of fixed length. Each record also contains a position vector
   applicable at the midpoint of its coverage interval.
 
   The records within a segment are ordered by increasing initial epoch.
   All records contain the same number of coefficients. A segment of this
   type is structured as
 
      +---------------+
      | Record 1      |
      +---------------+
      | Record 2      |
      +---------------+
        .
        .
        .
      +---------------+
      | Record N      |
      +---------------+
      | DSCALE        |
      +---------------+
      | TSCALE        |
      +---------------+
      | INITJD        |
      +---------------+
      | INITFR        |
      +---------------+
      | INTLEN        |
      +---------------+
      | RSIZE         |
      +---------------+
      | N             |
      +---------------+
 
   A set of seven parameters at the end of the segment provides the
   information needed to determine the location of the record corresponding
   to a particular epoch and to determine the units associated with the
   data:
 
       1.   DSCALE is the distance scale used for both position and
            velocity; DSCALE has units of km. For example, if the distance
            units are AU, then DSCALE is the value of the AU in km.
 
       2.   TSCALE is the time scale used for velocity; TSCALE has units of
            TDB seconds. For example, if the time units of the velocity
            data are TDB Julian days, then TSCALE is 86400.
 
       3.   INITJD is the integer part of the TDB Julian date of the
            initial epoch of the first record. INITJD has units of Julian
            days. INITJD may be less than, equal to, or greater than the
            initial epoch.
 
       4.   INITFR is the fractional part of the TDB Julian date of the
            initial epoch of the first record. INITFR has units of Julian
            days. INITFR has magnitude strictly less than 1 day. The sum
            INITJD + INITFR equals the TDB Julian date of the initial epoch
            of the first record.
 
       5.   INTLEN is the length of the interval covered by each record, in
            TDB Julian days.
 
       6.   RSIZE is the total size of (number of array elements in) each
            record. The same number of coefficients is always used for each
            component, and all records are the same size. RSIZE is 3 +
            3*(DEGP+1), where DEGP is the common degree of the Chebyshev
            expansions for each velocity component.
 
       7.   N is the number of records contained in the segment.
 
   Each record is structured as follows:
 
      +------------------+
      | X  data          |
      +------------------+
      | Y  data          |
      +------------------+
      | Z  data          |
      +------------------+
 
   where each data section for coordinate I contains
 
      +-------------------------------------------------+
      | Chebyshev coefficients for velocity component I |
      +-------------------------------------------------+
      | Position component I at interval midpoint       |
      +-------------------------------------------------+
 
   The velocity coefficients have units of DSCALE km/TSCALE seconds:
   multiplying a Chebyshev expansion's value by DSCALE/TSCALE converts
   velocity to units of km/s.
 
   The position at a record's midpoint epoch is given in units of DSCALE
   km: multiplying the position by DSCALE converts the position to units of
   km.
 
   Type 20 data are used to compute states as follows: for a given time T
   seconds past J2000 TDB, let MID and RADIUS be the midpoint and radius,
   expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB, of the record coverage interval
   that contains T: the coverage interval is the time span
 
      MID - RADIUS : MID + RADIUS
 
   The velocity at T of the body relative to its center of motion is given
   by the value of the corresponding record's Chebyshev expansions at S,
   where
 
      S = (T - MID) / RADIUS
 
   The position of the body relative to its center of motion at T is given
   by
 
                                            S
      (Position at MID) +  RADIUS*( Integral ( Velocity ) )
                                            0
 
   The subroutine SPKE20 contains the algorithm used to construct a state
   from a particular logical record.
 
   To facilitate the creation of Type 20 segments, a segment writing
   routine called SPKW20 has been provided. This routine takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a
   complete description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
 
 
Type 21: Extended Modified Difference Arrays
 
   SPK data type 21 contains extended Modified Difference Arrays (MDA),
   also called ``difference lines.'' These data structures use the same
   mathematical trajectory representation as SPK data type 1, but type 21
   allows use of larger, higher-degree MDAs.
 
   This data type is normally used for spacecraft whose ephemerides are
   produced by JPL's principal trajectory integrator---DPTRAJ. Difference
   lines are extracted from spacecraft trajectory files (``P-files'' and
   ``PV-files'') created by DPTRAJ.
 
   Each segment containing Modified Difference Arrays contains an arbitrary
   number of logical records. Each record contains difference line
   coefficients applicable over a time interval containing a reference
   epoch, along with the state at that epoch. The time intervals of
   adjacent records overlap at their common endpoints.
 
   The contents of the records themselves are described in [163]. The
   subroutine SPKE21 contains the algorithm used to construct a state from
   a particular record and epoch.
 
   The records within a segment are ordered by increasing final epoch. The
   final epochs associated with the records must be distinct.
 
   A segment of this type is structured as follows:
 
      +-----------------------------------------+
      | Record 1 (difference line coefficients) |
      +-----------------------------------------+
      | Record 2 (difference line coefficients) |
      +-----------------------------------------+
        .
        .
        .
      +-----------------------------------------+
      | Record N (difference line coefficients) |
      +-----------------------------------------+
      | Epoch 1                      |
      +------------------------------+
      | Epoch 2                      |
      +------------------------------+
        .
        .
        .
      +------------------------------+
      | Epoch N                      |
      +------------------------------+
      | Epoch 100                    |   (First directory epoch)
      +------------------------------+
      | Epoch 200                    |   (Second directory epoch)
      +------------------------------+
        .
        .
        .
      +------------------------------+
      | Epoch (N/100)*100            |   (Final directory epoch)
      +------------------------------+
      | Difference line size         |
      +------------------------------+
      | N                            |
      +------------------------------+
 
   The number of records in a segment, N, can be arbitrarily large.
 
   Records 1 through N contain the difference line coefficients and other
   constants needed to compute state data. Each one of these records
   contains DLSIZE double precision numbers, where DLSIZE is in the range
 
      71 : (4*MAXTRM) + 1
 
   inclusive. MAXTRM is declared in the SPICELIB include file spk21.inc.
 
   A list of the final epochs of the records is stored immediately after
   the last record.
 
   Following the list of epochs is a second list, the ``directory,''
   containing every 100th epoch from the previous list. If there are N
   epochs, there will be N/100 directory epochs. If there are fewer than
   100 epochs, then the segment will not contain any directory epochs.
   Directory epochs are used to speed up access to desired records.
 
   The penultimate element of the segment is the difference line size. The
   final element in the segment is the number of records contained in the
   segment, N.
 
   The index of the record providing ephemeris data for a user-specified
   epoch is the index of the first epoch in the segment's epoch list not
   less than the specified epoch.
 
 
Appendix A --- Summary of SP-kernel Routines
===========================================================================
 
 
Summary of Mnemonics
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   SPICELIB contains a family of subroutines that are designed specifically
   for use with SPK files. The name of each routine begins with the letters
   `SPK', followed by a two- or three-character mnemonic. For example, the
   routine that returns the state of one body with respect to another is
   named SPKEZ, pronounced `S-P-K-E-Z'.
 
   Many of the routines listed are entry points of another routine. If a
   routine is an entry point, the parent routine's name will be listed
   inside brackets preceding the mnemonic translation.
 
   The following is a complete list of mnemonics and translations, in

Appendix B --- A Template for SPK Comments
===========================================================================
 
   An undocumented ephemeris is in many respects worse than undocumented
   source code. With source code you can at least read the code and perhaps
   discern the function of the source code. An ephemeris on the other hand
   is a binary file. All it contains are numbers. It's very difficult to
   determine the purpose of an ephemeris simply from the state information
   it contains. For this reason, any ephemeris created for use by anyone
   other than yourself needs documentation.
 
   If you create SPK files NAIF strongly recommends that you include
   descriptive documentation in the comments portion of the SPK file. You
   can use the utility program COMMNT to insert comments into the file, or
   you may use the routines in the SPC family to insert the comments when
   you create the SPK file. (See commnt.ug or spc.req for further details.)
 
   This appendix addresses the contents of your comments. What will others
   (or yourself) want to know about the SPK file weeks, months or years
   after it has been created? Providing this information can be a
   challenge. It's difficult to know in advance all the questions someone
   might ask about an ephemeris you've created. To assist with this task
   NAIF has devised a ``template'' that you may wish to use as a starting
   point when creating the comments for an SPK file.
 
 
Constraints
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The comments you place in an SPK file must be plain ASCII text. Each
   line of text must consist of 80 or fewer characters. The text must
   contain only printing characters (ASCII characters 32 through 126).
 
 
The Basic Template
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Here's one way to create the comments for an SPK file.
 
 
Objects in the Ephemeris
 
   List the names and NAIF ID codes for the objects in the file.
 
 
Approximate Time Coverage
 
   Provide a summary of the time for which states are available for the
   objects in the file. If you use UTC times in this summary and the
   ephemeris extends more than 6 months into the future, you should
   probably state that the times are approximate. You don't know when
   leapseconds will occur more than a few months in advance, so you can't
   know the exact UTC time boundaries for the ephemeris if it extends years
   into the future.
 
 
Status
 
   Provide the ``status'' of the ephemeris. Tell the user why this
   ephemeris was created and for whom it is intended. For example, if this
   is the second in a series of ephemerides that will be produced for some
   object tell which ephemeris this one supersedes. Tell the user when the
   next ephemeris in the series will be available. Is the ephemeris
   suitable only for preliminary studies? Is it good for all Earth based
   observations? Is this an official operational product? Are there
   situations for which the ephemeris is not suitable?
 
 
Pedigree
 
   Provide a production summary for the ephemeris. Tell when the ephemeris
   was produced (the system time stamp may not port if the file is copied
   to other systems). Say who produced the ephemeris; what source products
   were used in the production; what version of the producing program was
   used in the creation of the ephemeris. If the ephemeris is based on a
   set of recent observations, say so. In short give the user the pedigree
   of this ephemeris. This information is mostly for your benefit. If a
   problem arises with the ephemeris, you will know how the problem was
   created and have a better chance of fixing the problem.
 
 
Usage
 
   Provide information the user will need to effectively use the ephemeris.
   Tell the user what other SPICE kernels are needed to use this ephemeris.
   For example, if the ephemeris contains only the state of an asteroid
   relative to the sun, the user will probably need a planetary ephemeris
   to effectively use the one you've created. Recommend a planetary
   ephemeris to use with your SPK file. If the ephemeris contains states of
   objects relative to non-inertial frames, the user will probably need
   other kernels so that various state transformations can be performed.
   Recommend which of these kernels the user should use with your SPK file.
 
 
Accuracy
 
   If possible give some estimate as to the accuracy of your SPK file. Use
   numbers. Words such as ``this is the best available'' do not convey how
   much you know about the ephemeris.
 
 
Special Notes
 
   Provide a description of any special properties of this ephemeris. For
   example, if some observation seems to be in conflict with this ephemeris
   you should probably point this out.
 
 
References
 
   List any references that may be relevant to the understanding of the
   ephemeris. For example, if the ephemeris is based upon observations
   contained in the literature, site the appropriate articles. If there is
   some technical memorandum or private communication that addresses
   certain aspects of this ephemeris list it. This will allow you to more
   easily answer questions about the ephemeris.
 
 
Contacts
 
   List your phone number, mail or e-mail address so that users of the
   ephemeris will be able to get in touch with you to ask questions or
   offer praise.

September 04, 2002
 
   Updated to reflect addition of SPK type 18.
 
   Added a brief discussion of the DAF run-time binary file format
   translation capability now present in the SPICE Toolkit.
 
 
July 21, 2001
 
   A few typos were corrected.
 
   Because of the substantial changes made in this revision of the Fortran
   edition of the SPK Required Reading document, the description of those
   changes is included here.
 
 
March 1, 2000
 
   This version describes the Hermite data types 12 and 13.
 
 
October 14, 1999
 
   The routines
 
      SPKPOS
      SPKEZP
      SPKGPS
      SPKAPO
 
   were added with version N0050 of the SPICE Toolkit. These routines are
   the ``position only'' equivalents of state routines
 
      SPKEZR
      SPKEZ
      SPKGEO
      SPKAPP
 
   respectively. The calling sequences of the position only routines are
   identical to the state routines. However, where the state routines
   return 6-vectors (position and velocity), the position only routines
   return a 3-vector (just position). Moreover, the positions returned by
   the position only routines agree with the positions returned by the
   state routines.
 
   Although the position only routines do not return as much information as
   the state routines (they don't return velocity), they are in some
   respects more general than the state routines. This is due to the link
   between the frame system and the SPK system. Some reference frames do
   not contain rate information. Consequently when a state is requested
   relative to such a frame, the state routines cannot perform
   transformations on the velocity components of the state. However, since
   the position only routines are not sensitive to the rate information,
   they can still perform position transformations and return the requested
   position.
 
 
March 2, 1998
 
   This version contains corrections of typographical errors and
   miscellaneous format changes. A note has been added on porting SPK files
   between SPICELIB and CSPICE (the ANSI C version of SPICELIB).
 
 
June 24, 1997
 
   This version of this document is a major reorganization and expansion of
   the material presented in the December 1994 version.
 
   Because of the substantial changes made in this revision, the
   description of those changes is retained here.
 
   When the SPK system was introduced, states of objects (positions and
   velocities) were stored relative to inertial frames and retrieved
   relative to inertial frames. Beginning with version 41 of the SPICE
   Toolkit, states can be stored relative to both inertial and non-inertial
   frames. Moreover, states may be retrieved relative to both inertial and
   non-inertial frames. Non-inertial frames may be tied to the rotation of
   a planet, the orientation of some structure on a spacecraft, an Earth
   based telescope, etc. By expanding the SPK system in this way,
   computation that previously required dozens lines of code may now be
   reduced to three or four lines of code.
 
   This version of the ``SPK Required Reading'' documents for the first
   time this important expansion of the SPK system.
 
   Also in this version, we document:
 
       1.   the ability to request states of objects by name instead of by
            object ID codes;
 
       2.   the addition of SPK data Type 10 which allows the incorporation
            of NORAD ``two-line'' elements for Earth orbiters into the SPK
            system;
 
       3.   the addition of SPK data Type 14 which supports Chebyshev
            interpolation over non-uniformly spaced time intervals;
 
       4.   the addition of SPK data Type 17 which supports the inclusion
            of equinoctial elements into the SPK system.
 
   The complete list of routines that are documented for the first time is:
 
      LTIME
      SPKEZR
      SPKPVN
      SPKE10
      SPKE14
      SPKE17
      SPKR10
      SPKR14
      SPKR17
      SPKS10
      SPKS14
      SPKS17
