     METHOD      is a short string providing parameters defining
                 the computation method to be used. Parameters
                 include, but are not limited to, the shape model
                 used to represent the surface of the target body.

                 The only choice currently supported is

                    'Ellipsoid'        The illumination angle
                                       computation uses a triaxial
                                       ellipsoid to model the surface
                                       of the target body. The
                                       ellipsoid's radii must be
                                       available in the kernel pool.

                 Neither case nor white space are significant in 
                 METHOD. For example, the string ' eLLipsoid ' is 
                 valid.                 


     TARGET      is the name of the target body. TARGET is
                 case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
                 TARGET are not significant. Optionally, you may
                 supply a string containing the integer ID code for
                 the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
                 legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
                 target body.

     ET          is the epoch, expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB,
                 for which the apparent illumination angles at the
                 specified surface point on the target body, as seen
                 from the observing body, are to be computed.


     FIXREF      is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered
                 reference frame associated with the target body. The
                 input surface point SPOINT and the output vector
                 SRFVEC are expressed relative to this reference
                 frame. The string FIXREF is case-insensitive, and
                 leading and trailing blanks in FIXREF are not
                 significant.


     ABCORR      is the aberration correction to be used in computing
                 the position and orientation of the target body and
                 the location of the Sun.
         
                 For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
                 illumination angles seen by the observer are desired,
                 normally either of the corrections 
              
                    'LT+S' 
                    'CN+S'
     
                 should be used. These and the other supported options
                 are described below. ABCORR may be any of the 
                 following:

                    'NONE'     No aberration correction.

                 Let LT represent the one-way light time between the
                 observer and SPOINT (note: NOT between the observer
                 and the target body's center). The following values
                 of ABCORR apply to the &quot;reception&quot; case in which
                 photons depart from SPOINT at the light-time
                 corrected epoch ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's
                 location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct both the position of SPOINT as
                               seen by the observer, and the position
                               of the Sun as seen by the target, for
                               light time.

                    'LT+S'     Correct both the position of SPOINT as
                               seen by the observer, and the position
                               of the Sun as seen by the target, for
                               light time and stellar aberration.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equations for target and the Sun, the
                               &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates until the
                               solution converges.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time and
                               stellar aberration corrections. This
                               option produces a solution that is at
                               least as accurate at that obtainable
                               with the 'LT+S' option. Whether the
                               'CN+S' solution is substantially more
                               accurate depends on the geometry of the
                               participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed.

                 Neither case nor white space are significant in
                 ABCORR. For example, the string 

                   'Lt + s'

                 is valid.
                               

     OBSRVR      is the name of the observing body. The observing body
                 is an ephemeris object: it typically is a spacecraft,
                 the earth, or a surface point on the earth. OBSRVR is
                 case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
                 OBSRVR are not significant. Optionally, you may
                 supply a string containing the integer ID code for
                 the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
                 legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
                 observer.

                 OBSRVR may be not be identical to TARGET.


     SPOINT      is a surface point on the target body, expressed in
                 Cartesian coordinates, relative to the body-fixed
                 target frame designated by FIXREF.

                 SPOINT need not be visible from the observer's
                 location at the epoch ET.

                 The components of SPOINT have units of km.

<PRE>
     TRGEPC      is the &quot;surface point epoch.&quot; TRGEPC is defined as
                 follows: letting LT be the one-way light time between
                 the observer and the input surface point SPOINT,
                 TRGEPC is either the epoch ET-LT or ET depending on
                 whether the requested aberration correction is,
                 respectively, for received radiation or omitted. LT
                 is computed using the method indicated by ABCORR.

                 TRGEPC is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.


     SRFVEC      is the vector from the observer's position at ET to
                 the aberration-corrected (or optionally, geometric)
                 position of SPOINT, where the aberration corrections
                 are specified by ABCORR. SRFVEC is expressed in the
                 target body-fixed reference frame designated by
                 FIXREF, evaluated at TRGEPC.
  
                 The components of SRFVEC are given in units of km.

                 One can use the SPICELIB function <a href="vnorm.html">VNORM</a> to obtain the
                 distance between the observer and SPOINT:

                    DIST = <a href="vnorm.html">VNORM</a> ( SRFVEC )

                 The observer's position OBSPOS, relative to the
                 target body's center, where the center's position is
                 corrected for aberration effects as indicated by
                 ABCORR, can be computed via the call:

                    CALL <a href="vsub.html">VSUB</a> ( SPOINT, SRFVEC, OBSPOS )

                 To transform the vector SRFVEC from a reference frame
                 FIXREF at time TRGEPC to a time-dependent reference
                 frame REF at time ET, the routine <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> should be
                 called. Let XFORM be the 3x3 matrix representing the
                 rotation from the reference frame FIXREF at time
                 TRGEPC to the reference frame REF at time ET. Then
                 SRFVEC can be transformed to the result REFVEC as
                 follows:

                     CALL <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> ( FIXREF, REF,    TRGEPC, ET, XFORM )
                     CALL <a href="mxv.html">MXV</a>    ( XFORM,  SRFVEC, REFVEC )

     PHASE       is the phase angle at SPOINT, as seen from OBSRVR at
                 time ET. This is the angle between the negative of
                 the vector SRFVEC and the SPOINT-Sun vector at
                 TRGEPC. Units are radians. The range of PHASE is
                 [0, pi].  

     SOLAR       is the solar incidence angle at SPOINT, as seen from
                 OBSRVR at time ET. This is the angle between the
                 surface normal vector at SPOINT and the SPOINT-Sun
                 vector at TRGEPC. Units are radians. The range of
                 SOLAR is [0, pi].  

     EMISSN      is the emission angle at SPOINT, as seen from OBSRVR
                 at time ET. This is the angle between the surface
                 normal vector at SPOINT and the negative of the
                 vector SRFVEC. Units are radians. The range of EMISSN
                 is [0, pi].

     1)  If the specified aberration correction is unrecognized, the
         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     2)  If either the target or observer input strings cannot be
         converted to an integer ID code, the error will be signaled
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     3)  If OBSRVR and TARGET map to the same NAIF integer ID code,
         the error will be signaled by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.

     4)  If the input target body-fixed frame FIXREF is not
         recognized, the error will be signaled by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine. A frame name may fail to be
         recognized because a required frame specification kernel has
         not been loaded; another cause is a misspelling of the frame
         name.

     5)  If the input frame FIXREF is not centered at the target body,
         the error will be signaled by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.

     6)  If the input argument METHOD is not recognized, the error
         will be signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
         routine.

     7)  If the target and observer have distinct identities but are
         at the same location (for example, the target is Mars and the
         observer is the Mars barycenter), the error will be signaled
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     8)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to
         calling <b>ILUMIN</b>, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when
         light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data must
         be available to propagate the states of observer, target, and
         the Sun to the solar system barycenter.

     9)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target
         shape and triaxial radii of the target body have not been
         loaded into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>ILUMIN</b>, the
         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     10) The target must be an extended body: if any of the radii of
         the target body are non-positive, the error will be
         diagnosed and signaled by routines in the call tree of this
         routine.

     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
     this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and the
          Sun must be loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the
          states of target, observer, and the Sun relative to the
          solar system barycenter must be calculable from the
          available ephemeris data. Typically ephemeris data are made
          available by loading one or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - PCK data: if the target body shape is modeled as an
          ellipsoid, triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded
          into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a
          text PCK file via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must be
          loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file.

        - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert the
          observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of the
          target, that definition must be available in the kernel
          pool. Typically the definition is supplied by loading a
          frame kernel via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
     run, NOT every time this routine is called.

     The term &quot;illumination angles&quot; refers to following set of
     angles:


        phase angle              Angle between the vectors from the
                                 surface point to the observer and
                                 from the surface point to the Sun.

        solar incidence angle    Angle between the surface normal at

                                 vector from the surface point to the
                                 Sun.

        emission angle           Angle between the surface normal at
                                 the specified surface point and the
                                 vector from the surface point to the
                                 observer.
 
     The diagram below illustrates the geometric relationships
     defining these angles. The labels for the solar incidence,
     emission, and phase angles are &quot;s.i.&quot;, &quot;e.&quot;, and &quot;phase&quot;.

     Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector
     at the surface point, and the target-sun vector are coplanar,
     then phase is the sum of incidence and emission. This is rarely
     true; usually

        phase angle  &lt;  solar incidence angle + emission angle

     All of the above angles can be computed using light time
     corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or
     no aberration corrections. In order to describe apparent
     geometry as observed by a remote sensing instrument, both
     light time and stellar aberration corrections should be used.
     
     The way aberration corrections are applied by this routine
     is described below.

        Light time corrections
        ======================

           Observer-target surface point vector
           ------------------------------------

           Let ET be the epoch at which an observation or remote
           sensing measurement is made, and let ET - LT (&quot;LT&quot; stands
           for &quot;light time&quot;) be the epoch at which the photons
           received at ET were emitted from the surface point SPOINT.
           Note that the light time between the surface point and
           observer will generally differ from the light time between
           the target body's center and the observer.


           Target body's orientation
           -------------------------

           Using the definitions of ET and LT above, the target body's
           orientation at ET - LT is used. The surface normal is
           dependent on the target body's orientation, so the body's
           orientation model must be evaluated for the correct epoch.


           Target body -- Sun vector
           -------------------------

           The surface features on the target body near SPOINT will
           appear in a measurement made at ET as they were at ET-LT.
           In particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on
           the apparent location of the Sun as seen from the target
           body at ET-LT. So, a second light time correction is used
           to compute the position of the Sun relative to the surface
           point.


        Stellar aberration corrections
        ==============================

        Stellar aberration corrections are applied only if
        light time corrections are applied as well.

           Observer-target surface point body vector
           -----------------------------------------

           When stellar aberration correction is performed, the
           direction vector SRFVEC is adjusted so as to point to the
           apparent position of SPOINT: considering SPOINT to be an
           ephemeris object, SRFVEC points from the observer's
           position at ET to the light time and stellar aberration
           corrected position of SPOINT.

           Target body-Sun vector
           ----------------------

           The target body-Sun vector is the apparent position of the
           Sun, corrected for light time and stellar aberration, as
           seen from the target body at time ET-LT.
