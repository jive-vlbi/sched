     INST       indicates the name of an instrument, such as a
                spacecraft-mounted framing camera, the field of view
                (FOV) of which is to be used for an target intersection
                search: the direction from the observer to a target
                is represented by a ray, and times when the specified
                ray intersects the region of space bounded by the FOV
                are sought.

                The position of the instrument designated by INST is
                considered to coincide with that of the ephemeris
                object designated by the input argument OBSRVR (see
                description below).

                INST must have a corresponding NAIF ID and a frame
                defined, as is normally done in a frame kernel. It
                must also have an associated reference frame and a FOV
                shape, boresight and boundary vertices (or reference
                vector and reference angles) defined, as is usually
                done in an instrument kernel.

                See the header of the SPICELIB routine <a href="getfov.html">GETFOV</a> for a
                description of the required parameters associated with
                an instrument.


     RAYDIR     is the direction vector associated with a ray
                representing a target. The ray emanates from the
                location of the ephemeris object designated by the
                input argument OBSRVR and is expressed relative to the
                reference frame designated by RFRAME (see descriptions
                below).


     RFRAME     is the name of the reference frame associated with 
                the input ray's direction vector RAYDIR.

                Since light time corrections are not supported for
                rays, the orientation of the frame is always evaluated
                at the epoch associated with the observer, as opposed
                to the epoch associated with the light-time corrected
                position of the frame center.
                
                Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
                non-blank frame name are not significant in the string
                RFRAME.


     ABCORR     indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                when computing the ray's direction.

                The supported aberration correction options are

                   'NONE'          No correction.
                   'S'             Stellar aberration correction,
                                   reception case.
                   'XS'            Stellar aberration correction,
                                   transmission case.

                For detailed information, see the geometry finder
                required reading, gf.req. 

                Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
                in the string ABCORR.
 

     OBSRVR     is the name of the body from which the target
                represented by RAYDIR is observed. The instrument
                designated by INST is treated as if it were co-located
                with the observer.

                Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code
                for the body as a string.

                Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string OBSRVR.


     STEP       is the step size to be used in the search. STEP must
                be shorter than any interval, within the confinement
                window, over which the specified condition is met. In
                other words, STEP must be shorter than the shortest
                visibility event that the user wishes to detect. STEP
                also must be shorter than the minimum duration
                separating any two visibility events. However, STEP
                must not be *too* short, or the search will take an
                unreasonable amount of time.

                The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not
                the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
                precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
                See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for
                details.

                STEP has units of seconds. 


     CNFINE     is a SPICE window that confines the time period over
                which the specified search is conducted. CNFINE may
                consist of a single interval or a collection of 
                intervals. 

                The endpoints of the time intervals comprising CNFINE
                are interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.
                
                See the Examples section below for a code example 
                that shows how to create a confinement window.
                
                CNFINE must be initialized by the caller via the
                SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     RESULT     is a SPICE window representing the set of time
                intervals, within the confinement period, when the
                input ray is &quot;visible&quot;; that is, when the ray is
                contained in the space bounded by the specified
                instrument's field of view.

                The endpoints of the time intervals comprising RESULT
                are interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.

                If RESULT is non-empty on input, its contents
                will be discarded before <b>GFRFOV</b> conducts its
                search.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Parameters">Parameters</a></h4>
<PRE>
     LBCELL     is the lower bound for SPICE cell arrays.

     CNVTOL     is the convergence tolerance used for finding
                endpoints of the intervals comprising the result
                window. CNVTOL is used to determine when binary
                searches for roots should terminate: when a root is
                bracketed within an interval of length CNVTOL; the
                root is considered to have been found.

                The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
                by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
                data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
                inferior to their precision.

     MAXVRT     is the maximum number of vertices that may be used
                to define the boundary of the specified instrument's
                field of view.

     MARGIN     is a small positive number used to constrain the
                orientation of the boundary vectors of polygonal
                FOVs. Such FOVs must satisfy the following constraints:

                   1)  The boundary vectors must be contained within
                       a right circular cone of angular radius less
                       than than (pi/2) - MARGIN radians; in other
                       words, there must be a vector A such that all
                       boundary vectors have angular separation from
                       A of less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians.

                   2)  There must be a pair of boundary vectors U, V 
                       such that all other boundary vectors lie in
                       the same half space bounded by the plane
                       containing U and V. Furthermore, all other
                       boundary vectors must have orthogonal
                       projections onto a specific plane normal to
                       this plane (the normal plane contains the angle
                       bisector defined by U and V) such that the
                       projections have angular separation of at least
                       2*MARGIN radians from the plane spanned by U
                       and V.

                 MARGIN is currently set to 1.D-12.

     parameters used throughout the GF system.

     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
         that if the step size is non-positive, the error 
         SPICE(INVALIDSTEPSIZE) will be signaled.

     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

            - Truncation error in time values
            - Finite tolerance value
            - Errors in computed geometric quantities

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
         result window.

         The result window may need to be contracted slightly by the
         caller to achieve desired results. The SPICE window routine
         <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a> can be used to contract the result window.

     3)  If the observer's name cannot be mapped to an ID code, the
         error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled.

     4)  If the aberration correction flag calls for light time
         correction, the error SPICE(INVALIDOPTION) is signaled.

     5)  If the ray's direction vector is zero, the error
         SPICE(ZEROVECTOR) is signaled.

     6)  If the instrument name INST does not have corresponding NAIF
         ID code, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     7)  If the FOV parameters of the instrument are not present in
         the kernel pool, the error will be be diagnosed by routines
         in the call tree of this routine.

     8)  If the FOV boundary has more than MAXVRT vertices, the error
         will be be diagnosed by routines in the call tree of this
         routine.

     9)  If the instrument FOV is polygonal, and this routine cannot 
         find a ray R emanating from the FOV vertex such that maximum
         angular separation of R and any FOV boundary vector is within
         the limit (pi/2)-MARGIN radians, the error will be diagnosed
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If the FOV
         is any other shape, the same error check will be applied with
         the instrument boresight vector serving the role of R.

     10) If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute a
         requested state vector, the error will be diagnosed by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine.

     11) If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,
         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree 
         of this routine.

     12) If the output SPICE window RESULT has insufficient capacity
         to contain the number of intervals on which the specified
         visibility condition is met, the error will be diagnosed
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If the result
         window has size less than 2, the error SPICE(WINDOWTOOSMALL)
         will be signaled by this routine.

<h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4>
<PRE>
     Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
     before this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data:  ephemeris data for the observer for the period
          defined by the confinement window 'CNFINE' must be loaded.
          If aberration corrections are used, the state of the
          observer relative to the solar system barycenter must be
          calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically
          ephemeris data are made available by loading one or more SPK
          files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Data defining the reference frame associated with the
          instrument designated by INST must be available in the kernel
          pool. Additionally the name INST must be associated with an
          ID code. Normally these data are  made available by loading
          a frame kernel via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - IK data: the kernel pool must contain data such that
          the SPICELIB routine <a href="getfov.html">GETFOV</a> may be called to obtain
          parameters for INST. Normally such data are provided by
          an IK via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

     The following data may be required:

        - CK data: if the instrument frame is fixed to a spacecraft,
          at least one CK file will be needed to permit transformation
          of vectors between that frame and the J2000 frame.

        - SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
          kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
          (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
          (TDB).

        - Since the input ray direction may be expressed in any 
          frame, FKs, CKs, SCLK kernels, PCKs, and SPKs may be
          required to map the direction to the J2000 frame.

     Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every
     time this routine is called.

<h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4>

     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals when
     the specified ray in contained within the field of view of a
     specified instrument. We'll use the term &quot;visibility event&quot; to
     designate such an appearance. The set of time intervals resulting
     from the search is returned as a SPICE window.

     This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible, interface
     than does the SPICELIB routine <a href="gffove.html">GFFOVE</a> for conducting searches for
     visibility events. Applications that require support for progress
     reporting, interrupt handling, non-default step or refinement
     functions, or non-default convergence tolerance should call
     <a href="gffove.html">GFFOVE</a> rather than this routine.

     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient use
     of this routine in user applications.


     The Search Process
     ==================

     The search for visibility events is treated as a search for state
     transitions: times are sought when the state of the ray
     changes from &quot;not visible&quot; to &quot;visible&quot; or vice versa.

     Step Size
     =========

     Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows:
     first, the input step size is used to determine the time
     separation at which the visibility state will be sampled.
     Starting at the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be
     taken at each step. If a state change is detected, a root has
     been bracketed; at that point, the &quot;root&quot;--the time at which the
     state change occurs---is found by a refinement process, for
     example, via binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the visibility state is constant:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest visibility event
     duration and the shortest period between visibility events, within
     the confinement window.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the ray and
     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
     time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance 
     used by this routine is set by the parameter CNVTOL (defined
     in gf.inc).
 
     The value of CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
     data will be the limiting factor.

     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
     CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>, e.g.

        CALL <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>( tolerance value )

     Call <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
     searches will use the updated tolerance value.

     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be 
     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate. 
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect 
     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed. For an example, see
     the program CASCADE in the GF Example Programs chapter of the GF
     Required Reading, gf.req.

<h4><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h4>
<PRE>
     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine 
     specific arithmetic implementation. 


     1) This example is an extension of example #1 in the
        header of

           <a href="gftfov.html">GFTFOV</a>

        The problem statement for that example is

           Search for times when Saturn's satellite Phoebe is within
           the FOV of the Cassini narrow angle camera
           (CASSINI_ISS_NAC). To simplify the problem, restrict the
           search to a short time period where continuous Cassini bus
           attitude data are available.

           Use a step size of 10 seconds to reduce chances of missing
           short visibility events.

        Here we search the same confinement window for times when a
        selected background star is visible. We use the FOV of the
        Cassini ISS wide angle camera (CASSINI_ISS_WAC) to enhance the
        probability of viewing the star.

        The star we'll use has catalog number 6000 in the Hipparcos
        Catalog. The star's J2000 right ascension and declination,
        proper motion, and parallax are taken from that catalog.

        Use the meta-kernel from the <a href="gftfov.html">GFTFOV</a> example:
