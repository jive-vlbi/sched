     METHOD      is a short string providing parameters defining
                 the computation method to be used. Parameters
                 include, but are not limited to, the shape model
                 used to represent the surface of the target body.

                 The only choice currently supported is

                    'Ellipsoid'        The illumination angle
                                       computation uses a triaxial
                                       ellipsoid to model the surface
                                       of the target body. The
                                       ellipsoid's radii must be
                                       available in the kernel pool.

                 Neither case nor blanks are significant in METHOD.
                 For example, the string ' eLLipsoid ' is valid.


     ANGTYP      is a string specifying the type of illumination
                 angle for which a search is to be performed. The
                 possible values of ANGTYP are

                    'PHASE'
                    'INCIDENCE'
                    'EMISSION'

                 When the illumination source is the sun, the 
                 incidence angle is commonly called the &quot;solar 
                 incidence angle.&quot;

                 See the Particulars section below for a detailed
                 description of these angles.

                 Neither case nor white space are significant in 
                 ANGTYP. For example, the string ' Incidence ' is
                 valid.


     TARGET      is the name of a target body. The point at which the
                 illumination angles are defined is located on the
                 surface of this body.

                 Optionally, you may supply the integer ID code for
                 the object as an integer string. For example both
                 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate
                 the moon is the target body.

                 Neither case nor leading and trailing blanks are
                 significant in TARGET. For example, the string
                 ' Incidence ' is valid. Sequences of embedded blanks
                 are treated as a single blank. 


     ILLMN       is the name of the illumination source. This source
                 may be any ephemeris object. Case, blanks, and
                 numeric values are treated in the same way as for the
                 input TARGET.


     FIXREF      is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered
                 reference frame associated with the target body. The
                 input surface point SPOINT is expressed relative to
                 this reference frame, and this frame is used to
                 define the orientation of the target body as a
                 function of time.

                 The string FIXREF is case-insensitive, and leading
                 and trailing blanks in FIXREF are not significant.


     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
                 the observer-surface point vector, the surface point-
                 illumination source vector, and the target body
                 orientation to account for one-way light time and
                 stellar aberration.

                 Any &quot;reception&quot; correction accepted by <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> can be
                 used here. See the header of <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a detailed
                 description of the aberration correction options. For
                 convenience, the options are listed below:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction.   

                    'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation.

                    'LT+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time and stellar
                               aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation.

                    'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                               Newtonian light time correction.

                    'CN+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                               Newtonian light time and stellar
                               aberration corrections.

                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string
                 ABCORR.


     OBSRVR      is the name of an observing body. Case, blanks, and
                 numeric values are treated in the same way as for the
                 input TARGET.


     SPOINT      is a surface point on the target body, expressed in
                 Cartesian coordinates, relative to the body-fixed
                 target frame designated by FIXREF.

                 SPOINT need not be visible from the observer's
                 location in order for the constraint specified by
                 RELATE and REFVAL (see descriptions below) to be
                 satisfied.

                 The components of SPOINT have units of km.


     RELATE      is a relational operator used to define a constraint
                 on a specified illumination angle. The result window
                 found by this routine indicates the time intervals
                 where the constraint is satisfied. Supported values
                 of RELATE and corresponding meanings are shown below:

                    '&gt;'      The angle is greater than the reference
                             value REFVAL.

                    '='      The angle is equal to the reference
                             value REFVAL.

                    '&lt;'      The angle is less than the reference
                             value REFVAL.


                   'ABSMAX'  The angle is at an absolute maximum.

                   'ABSMIN'  The angle is at an absolute minimum.

                   'LOCMAX'  The angle is at a local maximum.

                   'LOCMIN'  The angle is at a local minimum.

                The caller may indicate that the window of interest is
                the set of time intervals where the angle is within a
                specified separation from an absolute extremum. The
                argument ADJUST (described below) is used to specify
                this separation.

                Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
                interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
                window: a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
                point of the confinement window.

                Case is not significant in the string RELATE.


     REFVAL     is the reference value used together with the argument
                RELATE to define an equality or inequality to be
                satisfied by the specified illumination angle. See the
                discussion of RELATE above for further information.

                The units of REFVAL are radians.


     ADJUST     is a parameter used to modify searches for absolute
                extrema: when RELATE is set to ABSMAX or ABSMIN and
                ADJUST is set to a positive value, <b>GFILUM</b> will find
                times when the specified illumination angle is within
                ADJUST radians of the specified extreme value.

                If ADJUST is non-zero and a search for an absolute
                minimum is performed, the result window contains
                time intervals when the specified illumination angle
                has values between the absolute minimum MIN
                MIN + ADJUST radians.

                If ADJUST is non-zero and the search is for an
                absolute maximum, the corresponding angle is between
                the absolute maximum MAX and MAX - ADJUST radians.
               
                ADJUST is not used for searches for local extrema,
                equality or inequality conditions.


     STEP       is the step size to be used in the search. STEP must
                be short enough for a search using this step size to
                locate the time intervals where the specified
                illumination angle is monotone increasing or
                decreasing. However, STEP must not be *too* short, or
                the search will take an unreasonable amount of time.

                The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not
                the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
                precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
                See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for
                details.

                STEP has units of seconds. 


     CNFINE     is a SPICE window that confines the time period over
                which the specified search is conducted. CNFINE may
                consist of a single interval or a collection of 
                intervals. 

                In some cases the confinement window can be used to
                greatly reduce the time window that must be searched
                for the desired solution. See the Particulars section
                below for further discussion.
                
                See the Examples section below for a code example 
                that shows how to create a confinement window.
                
                CNFINE must be initialized by the caller via the
                SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.


     MW         is a parameter specifying the length of the workspace
                array WORK (see description below) used by this
                routine. MW should be at least as large as TWICE the
                number of intervals within the search window on which
                the specified illumination angle is monotone increasing
                or decreasing. It does no harm to pick a value of
                MW larger than the minimum required to execute the
                specified search, but if MW is too small, the
                search will fail.
            

     WORK       is an array used to store workspace windows. This
                array should be declared by the caller as shown:

                   INCLUDE 'gf.inc'
                      ...

                   DOUBLE PRECISION    WORK ( LBCELL : MW, NWILUM )

                where MW is a constant declared by the caller and
                NWILUM is a constant defined in the SPICELIB INCLUDE
                file gf.inc.

                WORK need not be initialized by the caller.


     RESULT     is the result window. RESULT must be initialized via a
                call to <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>. RESULT must be declared and initialized
                with sufficient size to capture the full set of time
                intervals within the search window on which the 
                specified constraint is satisfied.

     WORK       is the input workspace array, modified by this
                routine. The caller should re-initialize this array
                before attempting to use it for any other purpose.

     RESULT     is the window of intervals, contained within the
                confinement window CNFINE, on which the specified
                constraint is satisfied.

                The endpoints of the time intervals comprising RESULT
                are interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.
 
                If RESULT is non-empty on input, its contents will be
                discarded before gfilum_c conducts its search.

                If the search is for local extrema, or for absolute
                extrema with ADJUST set to zero, then normally each
                interval of RESULT will be a singleton: the left and
                right endpoints of each interval will be identical.

                If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
                constraint, RESULT will be returned with a
                cardinality of zero.

     LBCELL     is the lower bound for SPICE Cell arrays.

     CNVTOL     is the default convergence tolerance used for finding
                endpoints of the intervals comprising the result
                window. CNVTOL is also used for finding intermediate
                results; in particular, CNVTOL is used for finding the
                windows on which the specified illumination angle is
                increasing or decreasing. CNVTOL is used to determine
                when binary searches for roots should terminate: when
                a root is bracketed within an interval of length
                CNVTOL, the root is considered to have been found.

                The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
                by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
                data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
                inferior to their precision.

                The calling program can reset the convergence
                tolerance; see the Particulars section below for
                further information.

     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
         that if the step size is non-positive, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDSTEP) is signaled.

     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

            - Truncation error in time values
            - Finite tolerance value
            - Errors in computed geometric quantities

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
         result window.

         The result window may need to be contracted slightly by the
         caller to achieve desired results. The SPICE window routine
         <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a> can be used to contract the result window.

     3)  If the window size MW is less than 2, the error 
         SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will be signaled.

     4)  If the window count NW is less than NWILUM, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will be signaled.

     5)  If an error (typically cell overflow) occurs while performing 
         window arithmetic, the error will be diagnosed by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     6)  If the output SPICE window RESULT has insufficient capacity
         to hold the set of intervals on which the specified
         illumination angle condition is met, the error will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If
         the result window has size less than 2, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will be signaled by this routine.

     7)  If the input target body-fixed frame FIXREF is not
         recognized, an error is signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine. A frame name may fail to be recognized
         because a required frame specification kernel has not been
         loaded; another cause is a misspelling of the frame name.

     8)  If the input frame FIXREF is not centered at the target body,
         an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
         routine.

     9)  If the input argument METHOD is not recognized, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDMETHOD) is signaled.

    10)  If the illumination angle type ANGTYP is not recognized,
         an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.

    11)  If the relational operator RELATE is not recognized, an 
         error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
         routine.

    12)  If the aberration correction specifier contains an
         unrecognized value, an error is signaled by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine.

    13)  If ADJUST is negative, an error is signaled by a routine in
         the call tree of this routine.

    14)  If any of the input body names do not map to NAIF ID
         codes, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.

    15)  If the target coincides with the observer or the illumination
         source, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.

    16)  If required ephemerides or other kernel data are not
         available, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.

     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
     this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and the
          illumination source must be loaded. If aberration
          corrections are used, the states of target, observer, and
          the illumination source relative to the solar system
          barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris
          data. Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading
          one or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - PCK data: if the target body shape is modeled as an
          ellipsoid (currently no other shapes are supported), 
          triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded
          into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a
          text PCK file via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must be
          loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file.

        - Frame data: if a frame definition not built into SPICE
          is required to convert the observer and target states to the
          body-fixed frame of the target, that definition must be
          available in the kernel pool. Typically the definition is
          supplied by loading a frame kernel via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
     run, NOT every time this routine is called.

     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
     within the confinement window when the specified illumination
     angle satisfies a caller-specified constraint. The resulting set
     of intervals is returned as a SPICE window.

     The term &quot;illumination angles&quot; refers to the following set of
     angles:


        phase angle              Angle between the vectors from the
                                 surface point to the observer and
                                 from the surface point to the 
                                 illumination source.

        incidence angle          Angle between the surface normal at
                                 the specified surface point and the
                                 vector from the surface point to the
                                 illumination source. When the sun is
                                 the illumination source, this angle is
                                 commonly called the &quot;solar incidence
                                 angle.&quot;

        emission angle           Angle between the surface normal at
                                 the specified surface point and the
                                 vector from the surface point to the
                                 observer.
 
     The diagram below illustrates the geometric relationships
     defining these angles. The labels for the incidence, emission,
     and phase angles are &quot;inc.&quot;, &quot;e.&quot;, and &quot;phase&quot;.

     Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector
     at the surface point, and the target-illumination source vector
     are coplanar, then phase is the sum of the incidence and emission
     angles. This rarely occurs; usually

        phase angle  &lt;  incidence angle + emission angle

     All of the above angles can be computed using light time
     corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or no
     aberration corrections. In order to describe apparent geometry as
     observed by a remote sensing instrument, both light time and
     stellar aberration corrections should be used.
     
     The way aberration corrections are applied by this routine
     is described below.

        Light time corrections
        ======================

           Observer-target surface point vector
           ------------------------------------

           Let ET be the epoch at which an observation or remote
           sensing measurement is made, and let ET - LT (&quot;LT&quot; stands
           for &quot;light time&quot;) be the epoch at which the photons
           received at ET were emitted from the surface point SPOINT.
           Note that the light time between the surface point and
           observer will generally differ from the light time between
           the target body's center and the observer.


           Target body's orientation
           -------------------------

           Using the definitions of ET and LT above, the target body's
           orientation at ET - LT is used. The surface normal is
           dependent on the target body's orientation, so the body's
           orientation model must be evaluated for the correct epoch.


           Target body -- illumination source vector
           -----------------------------------------

           The surface features on the target body near SPOINT will
           appear in a measurement made at ET as they were at ET-LT.
           In particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on
           the apparent location of the illumination source as seen
           from the target body at ET-LT. So, a second light time
           correction is used to compute the position of the
           illumination source relative to the surface point.


        Stellar aberration corrections
        ==============================

        Stellar aberration corrections are applied only if
        light time corrections are applied as well.

           Observer-target surface point body vector
           -----------------------------------------

           When stellar aberration correction is performed, the
           observer-to-surface point direction vector, which we'll
           call SRFVEC, is adjusted so as to point to the apparent
           position of SPOINT: considering SPOINT to be an ephemeris
           object, SRFVEC points from the observer's position at ET to
           the light time and stellar aberration
           corrected position of SPOINT.

           Target body-illumination source vector
           --------------------------------------

           The target body-illumination source vector is the apparent
           position of the illumination source, corrected for light
           time and stellar aberration, as seen from the surface point
           SPOINT at time ET-LT.


     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
     use of this routine in user applications.
     

     The Search Process
     ==================

     Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
     routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
     periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified
     illumination angle is monotone increasing and monotone decreasing.
     Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE window.
     Having found these windows, all of the illumination angle's local
     extrema within the confinement window are known. Absolute extrema
     then can be found very easily.

     Within any interval of these &quot;monotone&quot; windows, there will be at
     most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
     of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
     the union of

        - the set of points where an equality constraint is met
        - the boundary points of the confinement window

     the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
     found easily once the monotone windows have been found.
      

     Step Size
     =========

     The monotone windows (described above) are found via a two-step
     search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
     searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
     determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
     change of the illumination angle will be sampled. Starting at the
     left endpoint of an interval, samples will be taken at each step.
     If a change of sign is found, a root has been bracketed; at that
     point, the time at which the rate of change of the selected
     illumination angle is zero can be found by a refinement process,
     for example, via binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the illumination angle is monotone:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
     intervals (within the confinement window).

     The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
     of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
     the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
     shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
     of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
     result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
     monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
     state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
     specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
     miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
     shortest solution interval.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target,
     observer, and illumination source can be a valuable aid in
     picking a reasonable step size. In general, the user can
     compensate for lack of such knowledge by picking a very short
     step size; the cost is increased computation time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine
     involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process
     to locate them. &quot;Roots&quot; are both times when local extrema are
     attained and times when the illumination angle is equal to a
     reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising the
     result window are either endpoints of intervals of the
     confinement window or roots.

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The convergence tolerance used by this
     routine is set via the parameter CNVTOL.
 
     The value of CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
     data will be the limiting factor.

     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
     CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>, e.g.

        CALL <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>( tolerance value in seconds )

     Call <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
     searches will use the updated tolerance value.

     Searches over time windows of long duration may require use of
     larger tolerance values than the default: the tolerance must be
     large enough so that it, when added to or subtracted from the
     confinement window's lower and upper bounds, yields distinct time
     values.

     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be
     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed.

     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine 
     specific arithmetic implementation. 


     1) Determine time intervals over which the MER-1 (&quot;Opportunity&quot;)
        rover's location satisfies certain constraints on its
        illumination and visibility as seen from the Mars

        In this case we require the emission angle to be less than
        20 degrees and the solar incidence angle to be less than
        60 degrees.
