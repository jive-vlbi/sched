     UDFUNS     the routine that returns the value of the scalar
                quantity of interest at time ET. The calling sequence
                for UDFUNS is:

                   CALL UDFUNS ( ET, VALUE )

                where:

                   ET      a double precision value representing
                           ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past
                           J2000 TDB, at which to determine the scalar
                           value.

                   VALUE   is the value of the scalar quantity
                           at ET.

     UDQDEC     the name of the routine that determines if the scalar
                quantity calculated by UDFUNS is decreasing.
                The calling sequence of UDQDEC is:

                   CALL UDQDEC ( UDFUNS, ET, ISDECR )

                where:

                   UDFUNS   the name of the scalar function as
                            defined above.

                   ET       a double precision value representing
                            ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past
                            J2000 TDB, at which to determine the time
                            derivative of UDFUNS.

                   ISDECR   a logical return indicating whether
                            or not the scalar value returned by UDFUNS
                            is decreasing. ISDECR returns true if the
                            time derivative of UDFUNS at ET is
                            negative.

     RELATE     the scalar string comparison operator indicating
                the numeric constraint of interest. Values are:

                   '&gt;'       value of scalar quantity greater than some
                             reference (REFVAL).

                   '='       value of scalar quantity equal to some
                             reference (REFVAL).

                   '&lt;'       value of scalar quantity less than some
                             reference (REFVAL).

                   'ABSMAX'  The scalar quantity is at an absolute
                             maximum.

                   'ABSMIN'  The scalar quantity is at an absolute
                              minimum.

                   'LOCMAX'  The scalar quantity is at a local
                             maximum.

                   'LOCMIN'  The scalar quantity is at a local
                             minimum.

                The caller may indicate that the region of interest
                is the set of time intervals where the quantity is
                within a specified distance of an absolute extremum.
                The argument ADJUST (described below) is used to
                specified this distance.

                Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
                interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
                window:  a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
                point of the confinement window.

                RELATE is insensitive to case, leading and
                trailing blanks.

     REFVAL     is the reference value used to define an equality or
                inequality to  satisfied by the scalar quantity.
                The units of REFVAL are those of the scalar quantity.

     ADJUST     the amount by which the quantity is allowed to vary
                from an absolute extremum.

                If the search is for an absolute minimum is performed,
                the resulting window contains time intervals when the
                geometric quantity value has values between
                ABSMIN and ABSMIN + ADJUST.

                If the search is for an absolute maximum, the
                corresponding range is  between ABSMAX - ADJUST and
                ABSMAX.

                ADJUST is not used for searches for local extrema,
                equality or inequality conditions and must have value
                zero for such searches.

     STEP       the double precision time step size to use in
                the search.

                STEP must be short enough to for a search using this
                step size to locate the time intervals where the
                scalar quantity function is monotone increasing or
                decreasing. However, STEP must not be *too* short,
                or the search will take an unreasonable amount of time.

                The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not
                the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
                precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
                See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for
                details.

                STEP has units of TDB seconds.

     CNFINE     is a SPICE window that confines the time period over
                which the specified search is conducted. CNFINE may
                consist of a single interval or a collection of
                intervals.

                In some cases the confinement window can be used to
                greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
                for the desired solution. See the Particulars section
                below for further discussion.

                See the Examples section below for a code example
                that shows how to create a confinement window.

                CNFINE must be initialized by the caller via the
                SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.

     MW         is a parameter specifying the length of the SPICE
                windows in the workspace array WORK (see description
                below) used by this routine.

                MW should be set to a number at least twice as large
                as the maximum number of intervals required by any
                workspace window. In many cases, it's not necessary to
                compute an accurate estimate of how many intervals are
                needed; rather, the user can pick a size considerably
                larger than what's really required.

                However, since excessively large arrays can prevent
                applications from compiling, linking, or running
                properly, sometimes MW must be set according to
                the actual workspace requirement. A rule of thumb
                for the number of intervals NINTVLS needed is

                   NINTVLS  =  2*N  +  ( M / STEP )

                where

                   N     is the number of intervals in the confinement
                         window

                   M     is the measure of the confinement window, in
                         units of seconds

                   STEP  is the search step size in seconds

                MW should then be set to

                   2 * NINTVLS

     NW         is a parameter specifying the number of SPICE windows
                in the workspace array WORK (see description below)
                used by this routine.  (The reason this dimension is
                an input argument is that this allows run-time
                error checking to be performed.)

                NW must be at least as large as the parameter NWUDS.

     WORK       is an array used to store workspace windows. This
                array should be declared by the caller as shown:

                    DOUBLE PRECISION     WORK ( LBCELL : MW,  NW )

                WORK need not be initialized by the caller.

     RESULT     a double precision SPICE window which will contain the
                search results. RESULT must be declared and initialized
                with sufficient size to capture the full set of time
                intervals within the search region on which the
                specified constraint is satisfied.

                RESULT must be initialized by the caller via the
                SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.

                If RESULT is non-empty on input, its contents
                will be discarded before <b>GFUDS</b> conducts its search.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     WORK       the input workspace array, modified by this
                routine.

     RESULT     is a SPICE window containing the time intervals within
                the confinement window, during which the specified
                condition on the scalar quantity is met.

                If the search is for local extrema, or for absolute
                extrema with ADJUST set to zero, then normally each
                interval of RESULT will be a singleton: the left and
                right endpoints of each interval will be identical.

                If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
                search, RESULT will be returned with a cardinality
                of zero.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Parameters">Parameters</a></h4>
<PRE>
     LBCELL   the integer value defining the lower bound for
              SPICE Cell arrays (a SPICE window is a kind of cell).

     CNVTOL   is the convergence tolerance used for finding
              endpoints of the intervals comprising the result
              window. CNVTOL is also used for finding intermediate
              results; in particular, CNVTOL is used for finding the
              windows on which the range rate is increasing
              or decreasing. CNVTOL is used to determine when binary
              searches for roots should terminate: when a root is
              bracketed within an interval of length CNVTOL; the
              root is considered to have been found.

              The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
              by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
              data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
              inferior to their precision.

     See INCLUDE file gf.inc for declarations and descriptions of
     parameters used throughout the GF system.

     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
         that if the step size is non-positive, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDSTEP) is signaled.

     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

            - truncation error in time values
            - finite tolerance value
            - errors in computed geometric quantities

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
         RESULT window. One technique to handle such a situation,
         slightly contract RESULT using the window routine <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a>.

     3)  If the workspace window size MW is less than 2 or not an even
         value, the error SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will signal. If the
         size of the workspace is too small, an error is signaled by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine.

     4)  If the size of the SPICE window RESULT is less than 2 or
         not an even value, the error SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will
         signal. If RESULT has insufficient capacity to contain the
         number of intervals on which the specified condition
         is met, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     5)  If the window count NW is less than NWUDS, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will be signaled.

     6)  If an error (typically cell overflow) occurs during
         window arithmetic, the error will be diagnosed by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     7)  If the relational operator RELATE is not recognized, an

         routine.

     8)  If ADJUST is negative, the error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) will
         signal from a routine in the call tree of this routine.

         A non-zero value for ADJUST when RELATE has any value other
         than &quot;ABSMIN&quot; or &quot;ABSMAX&quot; causes the error SPICE(INVALIDVALUE)
         to signal from a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     9)  If required ephemerides or other kernel data are not
         available, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.

     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
     this routine is called.

     If the scalar function requires access to ephemeris data:

        - SPK data: ephemeris data for any body over the
          time period defined by the confinement window must be
          loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of
          target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
          must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.
          Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one
          or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - If non-inertial reference frames are used, then PCK
          files, frame kernels, C-kernels, and SCLK kernels may be
          needed.

     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
     run, NOT every time this routine is called.

     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals

     UDQDEC Default Template
     =======================

     The user must supply a routine to determine whether sign of the
     time derivative of UDFUNS is positive or negative at ET. For
     cases where UDFUNS is numerically well behaved, the user
     may find it convenient to use a routine based on the below
     template. <a href="uddc.html">UDDC</a> determines the truth of the expression

        d (UDFUNS)
        --         &lt; 0
        dt

     using the library routine <a href="uddf.html">UDDF</a> to numerically calculate the
     derivative of UDFUNS using a three-point estimation.
     Please see the Examples section for an example of GFDECR use.

           CALL <a href="uddc.html">UDDC</a> ( UDFUNS, ET, DT, ISDECR )

           END

     The Search Process
     ==================

     Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
     routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
     periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified
     scalar function is monotone increasing and monotone
     decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE
     window. Having found these windows, all of the quantity
     function's local extrema within the confinement window are known.
     Absolute extrema then can be found very easily.

     Within any interval of these &quot;monotone&quot; windows, there will be at
     most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
     of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
     the union of

        - the set of points where an equality constraint is met
        - the boundary points of the confinement window

     the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
     found easily once the monotone windows have been found.


     Step Size
     =========

     The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step
     search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
     searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
     determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
     change of quantity function will be sampled. Starting at
     the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be taken at each
     step. If a change of sign is found, a root has been bracketed; at
     that point, the time at which the time derivative of the quantity
     function is zero can be found by a refinement process, for
     example, using a binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the quantity function is monotone:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
     intervals (within the confinement window).

     The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
     of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
     the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
     shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
     of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
     result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
     monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
     state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
     specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
     miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
     shortest solution interval.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and
     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
     time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance
     used by this routine is set by the parameter CNVTOL (defined
     in gf.inc).

     The value of CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
     data will be the limiting factor.

     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
     CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>, e.g.

        CALL <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>( tolerance value )

     Call <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
     searches will use the updated tolerance value.

     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be
     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect
     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed.

   SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 15-JUL-2014 (EDW)

       Correction to description of UDQDEC to show UDFUNS as
       an argument.

       Edit to comments to correct search description.

       Implemented use of ZZHOLDD to allow user to alter convergence
       tolerance.

       Removed the STEP &gt; 0 error check. The <a href="gfsstp.html">GFSSTP</a> call includes
       the check.

       Removed ZZGFREF call. That call now occurs in ZZGFRELX. Update
       to ZZGFRELX argument list to reflect this change in
       functionality.

       Added RETURN() check.
