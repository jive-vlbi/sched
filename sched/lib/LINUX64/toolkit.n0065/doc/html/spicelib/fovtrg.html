<PRE>
     INST       indicates the name of an instrument, such as a
                spacecraft-mounted framing camera. The field of view
                (FOV) of the instrument will be used to determine if
                the target is visible with respect to the instrument.

                The position of the instrument INST is considered to
                coincide with that of the ephemeris object OBSRVR (see
                description below).

                The size of the instrument's FOV is constrained by the
                following: There must be a vector A such that all of
                the instrument's FOV boundary vectors have an angular
                separation from A of less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians
                (see description below). For FOVs that are circular or
                elliptical, the vector A is the boresight. For FOVs
                that are rectangular or polygonal, the vector A is
                calculated.

                See the header of the SPICELIB routine <a href="getfov.html">GETFOV</a> for a
                description of the required parameters associated with
                an instrument.

                Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
                example, both 'CASSINI_ISS_NAC' and '-82360' are
                accepted. Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string.

     TARGET     is the name of the target body. This routine determines
                if the target body appears in the instrument's field of
                view. 

                Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
                example, both 'Moon' and '301' are accepted. Case and
                leading or trailing blanks are not significant in the
                string.

     TSHAPE     is a string indicating the geometric model used to
                represent the shape of the target body. The supported
                options are:

                   'ELLIPSOID'     Use a triaxial ellipsoid model,
                                   with radius values provided via the
                                   kernel pool. A kernel variable 
                                   having a name of the form

                                      'BODYnnn_RADII' 

                                   where nnn represents the NAIF
                                   integer code associated with the
                                   body, must be present in the kernel
                                   pool. This variable must be
                                   associated with three numeric
                                   values giving the lengths of the
                                   ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.

                   'POINT'         Treat the body as a single point.

                Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string.

     TFRAME     is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
                frame associated with the target body. Examples of
                such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and 'ITRF93'
                (for Earth).

                If the target body is modeled as a point, TFRAME
                is ignored and should be left blank. (Ex: ' ').

                Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
                non-blank frame name are not significant in the string.

     ABCORR     indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                when computing the target's position and orientation.
         
                For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
                position and orientation of the target seen by the
                observer are desired, normally either of the
                corrections:
              
                   'LT+S' 
                   'CN+S'
     
                should be used. These and the other supported options
                are described below. 

                Supported aberration correction options for
                observation (the case where radiation is received by
                observer at ET) are:

                   'NONE'         No correction.
                   'LT'           Light time only
                   'LT+S'         Light time and stellar aberration.
                   'CN'           Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                   'CN+S'         CN light time and stellar aberration.

                Supported aberration correction options for
                transmission (the case where radiation is emitted from
                observer at ET) are:

                   'XLT'          Light time only.
                   'XLT+S'        Light time and stellar aberration.
                   'XCN'          Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                   'XCN+S'        CN light time and stellar aberration.

                Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
                in the string.

     OBSRVR     is the name of the body from which the target is
                observed. The instrument INST is treated as if it were
                co-located with the observer.

                Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
                example, both 'CASSINI' and '-82' are accepted. Case
                and leading or trailing blanks are not significant in
                the string.

     ET         is the observation time in seconds past the J2000
                epoch.

     VISIBL     is .TRUE. if TARGET is fully or partially in the

     MAXVRT     is the maximum number of vertices that may be used
                to define the boundary of the specified instrument's
                field of view. See the INCLUDE file gf.inc for details.

     MARGIN     is a small positive number used to constrain the
                orientation of the boundary vectors of polygonal
                FOVs. Such FOVs must satisfy the following constraints:

                   1)  The boundary vectors must be contained within
                       a right circular cone of angular radius less
                       than (pi/2) - MARGIN radians; in other
                       words, there must be a vector A such that all
                       boundary vectors have angular separation from
                       A of less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians.

                   2)  There must be a pair of boundary vectors U, V 
                       such that all other boundary vectors lie in
                       the same half space bounded by the plane
                       containing U and V. Furthermore, all other
                       boundary vectors must have orthogonal
                       projections onto a specific plane normal to
                       this plane (the normal plane contains the angle
                       bisector defined by U and V) such that the
                       projections have angular separation of at least
                       2*MARGIN radians from the plane spanned by U
                       and V.

                MARGIN is currently set to 1.D-6.

     1)  If the name of either the target or observer cannot be
         translated to a NAIF ID code, the error will be diagnosed by
         a routine in the call tree of this routine.
         
     2)  If the specified aberration correction is an unrecognized
         value, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     3)  If the radii of a target body modeled as an ellipsoid cannot
         be determined by searching the kernel pool for a kernel
         variable having a name of the form

            'BODYnnn_RADII' 

         where nnn represents the NAIF integer code associated with
         the body, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine.

     4)  If the target and observer bodies are the same, the error will
         be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     5)  If the body model specifier TSHAPE is invalid, the error will
         be diagnosed either here or by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.

     6)  If a target body-fixed reference frame associated with a 
         non-point target is not recognized, the error will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     7)  If a target body-fixed reference frame is not centered at
         the corresponding target body, the error will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     8)  If the instrument name INST does not have a corresponding NAIF
         ID code, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     9)  If the FOV parameters of the instrument are not present in
         the kernel pool, the error will be diagnosed by routines
         in the call tree of this routine.

     10) If the FOV boundary has more than MAXVRT vertices, the error
         will be diagnosed by routines in the call tree of this
         routine.

     11) If the instrument FOV shape is a polygon or rectangle, and 
         this routine cannot find a ray R emanating from the FOV
         vertex such that maximum angular separation of R and any FOV
         boundary vector is within the limit (pi/2)-MARGIN radians,
         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine. If the FOV is any other shape, the same error
         check will be applied with the instrument boresight vector
         serving the role of R.

     12) If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute a
         requested state vector, the error will be diagnosed by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine.

     13) If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,

     Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
     before this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: ephemeris data for target and observer that 
          describe the ephemerides of these objects at the time ET.
          If aberration corrections are used, the states of
          target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
          must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.

        - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert
          the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of
          the target, that definition must be available in the kernel
          pool. Typically the definitions of frames not already
          built-in to SPICE are supplied by loading a frame kernel.

        - Data defining the reference frame in which the instrument's
          FOV is defined must be available in the kernel pool.
          Additionally the name INST must be associated with an ID
          code.

        - IK data: the kernel pool must contain data such that
          the SPICELIB routine <a href="getfov.html">GETFOV</a> may be called to obtain
          parameters for INST.

     The following data may be required:

        - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
          orientation data provided by variables in the kernel pool.

          Bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have radii
          lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool.

        - CK data: if the frame in which the instrument's FOV is
          defined is fixed to a spacecraft, at least one CK file will
          be needed to permit transformation of vectors between that
          frame and both J2000 and the target body-fixed frame.

        - SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
          kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
          (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
          (TDB).

     Kernel data are normally loaded via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> once per program run,
     NOT every time this routine is called.

     To treat the target as a ray rather than as an ephemeris object,
     use the higher-level SPICELIB routine <a href="fovray.html">FOVRAY</a>. <a href="fovray.html">FOVRAY</a> may be used
     to determine if distant target objects such as stars are visible

     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine 
     specific arithmetic implementation.

        six of Saturn's moons. Let's verify that the moons
        in the picture are Epimetheus, Atlas, Daphnis, Pan
        Janus, and Enceladus.

        To see this picture, visit:
        http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12741
        or go to the PDS Image Node's Image Atlas at
        http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/search.html.
        Select Cassini as the mission, ISS as the instrument,
        and enter 1_N1665078907.122 as the Product ID in the
        Product tab. Note: these directions may change as the
        PDS Imaging Node changes.

        Use the meta-kernel shown below to load the required SPICE
        kernels. For project meta-kernels similar to the one shown
        below, please see the PDS section of the NAIF FTP server.
        For example, look at the following path for Cassini

           This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
           example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
           assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
           required by SPICE-based user applications.

           In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
           kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
           current working directory.

           The names and contents of the kernels referenced
           by this meta-kernel are as follows:

        When this program was executed using gfortran on a PC Linux
        64 bit environment, the output was:

        Note: there were actually 7 of Saturn's satellites in the
        field-of-view of Cassini's narrow-angle camera. However, Anthe
        is very small and was probably obscured by other objects or
        shadow.
