     INST       indicates the name of an instrument, such as a
                spacecraft-mounted framing camera, the field of view
                (FOV) of which is to be used for a target intersection
                search: times when the specified target intersects the
                region of space corresponding to the FOV are sought.

                The position of the instrument designated by INST is
                considered to coincide with that of the ephemeris
                object designated by the input argument OBSRVR (see
                description below).

                INST must have a corresponding NAIF ID and a frame
                defined, as is normally done in a frame kernel. It
                must also have an associated reference frame and a FOV
                shape, boresight and boundary vertices (or reference
                vector and reference angles) defined, as is usually
                done in an instrument kernel.

                See the header of the SPICELIB routine <a href="getfov.html">GETFOV</a> for a
                description of the required parameters associated with
                an instrument.


     TARGET     is the name of the target body, the appearances of
                which in the specified instrument's field of view are
                sought. The body must be an ephemeris object.

                Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code
                for the body as a string. For example both 'MOON' and
                '301' are legitimate strings that designate the Moon.

                Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string TARGET.


     TSHAPE     is a string indicating the geometric model used to
                represent the shape of the target body. The supported
                options are:

                   'ELLIPSOID'     Use a triaxial ellipsoid model,
                                   with radius values provided via the
                                   kernel pool. A kernel variable 
                                   having a name of the form

                                      'BODYnnn_RADII' 

                                   where nnn represents the NAIF
                                   integer code associated with the
                                   body, must be present in the kernel
                                   pool. This variable must be
                                   associated with three numeric
                                   values giving the lengths of the
                                   ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.

                   'POINT'         Treat the body as a single point.

                Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string TSHAPE.


     TFRAME     is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
                frame associated with the target body. Examples of
                such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and 'ITRF93'
                (for the Earth).

                If the target body is modeled as a point, TFRAME
                is ignored and should be left blank.

                Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
                non-blank frame name are not significant in the string
                TFRAME.


     ABCORR     indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                when computing the target's position and orientation.
         
                For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
                position and orientation of the target seen by the
                observer are desired, normally either of the
                corrections
              
                   'LT+S' 
                   'CN+S'
     
                should be used. These and the other supported options
                are described below. 

                Supported aberration correction options for
                observation (the case where radiation is received by
                observer at ET) are:

                   'NONE'         No correction.
                   'LT'           Light time only
                   'LT+S'         Light time and stellar aberration.
                   'CN'           Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                   'CN+S'         CN light time and stellar aberration.

                Supported aberration correction options for
                transmission (the case where radiation is emitted from
                observer at ET) are:

                   'XLT'          Light time only.
                   'XLT+S'        Light time and stellar aberration.
                   'XCN'          Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                   'XCN+S'        CN light time and stellar aberration.

                For detailed information, see the GF Required Reading,
                gf.req. 

                Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
                in the string ABCORR.
 

     OBSRVR     is the name of the body from which the target is
                observed. The instrument designated by INST is treated
                as if it were co-located with the observer.

                Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code
                for the body as a string.

                Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string OBSRVR.


     STEP       is the step size to be used in the search. STEP must
                be shorter than any interval, within the confinement
                window, over which the specified condition is met. In
                other words, STEP must be shorter than the shortest
                visibility event that the user wishes to detect. STEP
                also must be shorter than the minimum duration
                separating any two visibility events. However, STEP
                must not be *too* short, or the search will take an
                unreasonable amount of time.

                The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not
                the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
                precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
                See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for
                details.

                STEP has units of seconds. 


     CNFINE     is a SPICE window that confines the time period over
                which the specified search is conducted. CNFINE may
                consist of a single interval or a collection of 
                intervals. 

                The endpoints of the time intervals comprising CNFINE
                are interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.

                See the Examples section below for a code example 
                that shows how to create a confinement window.
                
                CNFINE must be initialized by the caller via the
                SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     RESULT     is a SPICE window representing the set of time
                intervals, within the confinement period, when the
                target body is visible; that is, when the target body
                intersects the space bounded by the specified
                instrument's field of view.

                The endpoints of the time intervals comprising RESULT
                are interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.

                If RESULT is non-empty on input, its contents
                will be discarded before <b>GFTFOV</b> conducts its
                search.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Parameters">Parameters</a></h4>
<PRE>
     LBCELL     is the lower bound for SPICE cell arrays.

     CNVTOL     is the convergence tolerance used for finding
                endpoints of the intervals comprising the result
                window. CNVTOL is used to determine when binary
                searches for roots should terminate: when a root is
                bracketed within an interval of length CNVTOL, the
                root is considered to have been found.

                The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
                by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
                data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
                inferior to their precision.

     MAXVRT     is the maximum number of vertices that may be used
                to define the boundary of the specified instrument's
                field of view.

     MARGIN     is a small positive number used to constrain the
                orientation of the boundary vectors of polygonal
                FOVs. Such FOVs must satisfy the following constraints:

                   1)  The boundary vectors must be contained within
                       a right circular cone of angular radius less
                       than than (pi/2) - MARGIN radians; in other
                       words, there must be a vector A such that all
                       boundary vectors have angular separation from
                       A of less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians.

                   2)  There must be a pair of boundary vectors U, V 
                       such that all other boundary vectors lie in
                       the same half space bounded by the plane
                       containing U and V. Furthermore, all other
                       boundary vectors must have orthogonal
                       projections onto a specific plane normal to
                       this plane (the normal plane contains the angle
                       bisector defined by U and V) such that the
                       projections have angular separation of at least
                       2*MARGIN radians from the plane spanned by U
                       and V.

                 MARGIN is currently set to 1.D-12.

     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
         that if the step size is non-positive, the error 
         SPICE(INVALIDSTEPSIZE) will be signaled.

     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

            - Truncation error in time values
            - Finite tolerance value
            - Errors in computed geometric quantities

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
         result window.

         The result window may need to be contracted slightly by the
         caller to achieve desired results. The SPICE window routine
         <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a> can be used to contract the result window.

     3)  If the name of either the target or observer cannot be
         translated to a NAIF ID code, the error will be diagnosed by
         a routine in the call tree of this routine.
         
     4)  If the specified aberration correction is an unrecognized
         value, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     5)  If the radii of a target body modeled as an ellipsoid cannot
         be determined by searching the kernel pool for a kernel
         variable having a name of the form

            'BODYnnn_RADII' 

         where nnn represents the NAIF integer code associated with
         the body, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine.

     6)  If the target body coincides with the observer body OBSRVR,
         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.
         
     7)  If the body model specifier TSHAPE is invalid, the error will
         be diagnosed either here or by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.

     8)  If a target body-fixed reference frame associated with a 
         non-point target is not recognized, the error will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     9)  If a target body-fixed reference frame is not centered at
         the corresponding target body,  the error will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     10) If the instrument name INST does not have corresponding NAIF
         ID code, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     11) If the FOV parameters of the instrument are not present in
         the kernel pool, the error will be be diagnosed by routines
         in the call tree of this routine.

     12) If the FOV boundary has more than MAXVRT vertices, the error
         will be be diagnosed by routines in the call tree of this
         routine.

     13) If the instrument FOV is polygonal, and this routine cannot 
         find a ray R emanating from the FOV vertex such that maximum
         angular separation of R and any FOV boundary vector is within
         the limit (pi/2)-MARGIN radians, the error will be diagnosed
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If the FOV
         is any other shape, the same error check will be applied with
         the instrument boresight vector serving the role of R.

     14) If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute a
         requested state vector, the error will be diagnosed by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine.

     15) If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,
         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree 
         of this routine.

     16) If the output SPICE window RESULT has insufficient capacity
         to contain the number of intervals on which the specified
         visibility condition is met, the error will be diagnosed
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If the result
         window has size less than 2, the error SPICE(WINDOWTOOSMALL)
         will be signaled by this routine.

<h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4>
<PRE>
     Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
     before this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data:  ephemeris data for target and observer that 
          describes the ephemeris of these objects for the period
          defined by the confinement window, 'CNFINE' must be
          loaded.  If aberration corrections are used, the states of
          target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
          must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.
          Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one
          or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Frame data:  if a frame definition is required to convert
          the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of
          the target, that definition must be available in the kernel
          pool. Typically the definitions of frames not already
          built-in to SPICE are supplied by loading a frame kernel.

          Data defining the reference frame associated with the
          instrument designated by INST must be available in the
          kernel pool. Additionally the name INST must be associated
          with an ID code. Normally these data are  made available by
          loading a frame kernel via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - IK data: the kernel pool must contain data such that
          the SPICELIB routine <a href="getfov.html">GETFOV</a> may be called to obtain
          parameters for INST. Normally such data are provided by
          an IK via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

     The following data may be required:

        - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
          orientation data provided by variables in the kernel pool.
          Typically these data are made available by loading a text
          PCK file via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

          Bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have semi-axis
          lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool. Typically
          these data are made available by loading a text PCK file via
          <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - CK data: if the instrument frame is fixed to a spacecraft,
          at least one CK file will be needed to permit transformation
          of vectors between that frame and both J2000 and the target
          body-fixed frame.

        - SCLK data:  if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
          kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
          (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
          (TDB).

     Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every
     time this routine is called.

     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
     within the confinement window when any portion of a specified
     target body appears within the field of view of a specified
     instrument. We'll use the term &quot;visibility event&quot; to designate
     such an appearance. The set of time intervals resulting from the
     search is returned as a SPICE window.

     This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible, interface
     than does the SPICELIB routine <a href="gffove.html">GFFOVE</a> for conducting searches for
     visibility events. Applications that require support for progress
     reporting, interrupt handling, non-default step or refinement
     functions, or non-default convergence tolerance should call
     <a href="gffove.html">GFFOVE</a> rather than this routine.

     To treat the target as a ray rather than as an ephemeris object,
     use either the higher-level SPICELIB routine <a href="gfrfov.html">GFRFOV</a> or <a href="gffove.html">GFFOVE</a>.
     Those routines may be used to search for times when distant
     target objects such as stars are visible in an instrument FOV, as
     long the direction from the observer to the target can be modeled
     as a ray.

     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient use
     of this routine in user applications.


     The Search Process
     ==================

     The search for visibility events is treated as a search for state
     transitions: times are sought when the state of the target body
     changes from &quot;not visible&quot; to &quot;visible&quot; or vice versa.

     Step Size
     =========

     Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows:
     first, the input step size is used to determine the time
     separation at which the visibility state will be sampled.
     Starting at the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be
     taken at each step. If a state change is detected, a root has
     been bracketed; at that point, the &quot;root&quot;--the time at which the
     state change occurs---is found by a refinement process, for
     example, via binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the visibility state is constant:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest visibility event
     duration and the shortest period between visibility events, within
     the confinement window.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target and
     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
     time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance 
     used by this routine is set by the parameter CNVTOL (defined
     in gf.inc).
 
     The value of CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
     data will be the limiting factor.

     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
     CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>, e.g.

        CALL <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>( tolerance value )

     Call <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
     searches will use the updated tolerance value.

     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be 
     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate. 
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect 
     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed. For an example, see
     the program CASCADE in the GF Example Programs chapter of the GF
     Required Reading, gf.req.

<h4><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h4>

     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine 
     specific arithmetic implementation. 


     1) Search for times when Saturn's satellite Phoebe is within
        the FOV of the Cassini narrow angle camera (CASSINI_ISS_NAC).
        To simplify the problem, restrict the search to a short time
        period where continuous Cassini bus attitude data are
        available.

        Use a step size of 10 seconds to reduce chances of missing
        short visibility events.
        
        Use the meta-kernel shown below to load the required SPICE
        kernels.
