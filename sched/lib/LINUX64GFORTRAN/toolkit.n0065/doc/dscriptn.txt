 
Toolkit Contents Description
===========================================================================
 
 
Introduction
===========================================================================
 
   This document describes the structure and contents of the latest version
   of the SPICE toolkit for PC computers using LINUX operating system and
   GFORTRAN 64BIT compiler.
 
   Most FORTRAN compilers come with a large set of compilation options that
   can be used when compiling source code. The compiler options we (NAIF)
   used when creating the various object libraries are discussed in the
   section "LIB" that appears later in this document.
 
 
Version Information

Directory Structure and Contents
===========================================================================
 
   The top level directory, toolkit, contains the file makeall.csh. This is
   a C shell script that builds all of the object libraries and executables
   in the toolkit.

Using the Toolkit
===========================================================================
 
 
All Users
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   After completing your Toolkit installation it is extremely important
   that you carefully read the ``whats.new'' description of changes and
   additions if you haven't done so prior to the installation.
 
   The Toolkit contains two styles of documentation: a plain text version
   and a hyper-linked HTML version. NAIF recommends you use the HTML
   version because of the convenience of the hyper-linking. To do that load
   the top level index of the HTML documentation -- ``doc/html/index.html''
   -- into a web browser.
 
 
Repeat Users
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   If you are not a first time user, save your own application executables
   in a safe place and then re-link those application programs to the newly
   installed library, creating new executables. NAIF suggests you carefully
   re-test any critical applications to be sure they are working correctly
   -- you may have unknowingly taken advantage of a bug in the old library
   that has since been fixed.
 
   Be aware that sometimes a bug fix or a small algorithmic change in the
   new SPICE code could result in small changes in numeric results; this
   could show up in your regression test cases.
 
 
First Time Users
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   NAIF provides several means to help you get started using SPICE --
   tutorials, ``open book'' programming lessons, several ``cookbook
   programs,'' and extensive documentation. Which of these will best suit
   your needs, and in what order you should use these materials, depends on
   your training/background and your immediate needs for using SPICE. NAIF
   suggests you become familiar with the offerings from the NAIF website
   (http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov), most particularly the tutorials and lessons
   collections. You might also take time to read the ``Introduction to the
   SPICE System'' document.
 
   Please note that NAIF assumes you are familiar with how to write code in
   the language you have chosen, and that you know how to compile, link
   (``make'') and execute programs on your computer. If this is not the
   case you should first take some generic programming lessons before
   trying to tackle SPICE.
 
 
Appendix -- NAIF's File Naming Conventions
===========================================================================
 
   NAIF follows a set of conventions for naming files based on the contents
   of the files. This allows you to find certain types of files in a
   directory tree quickly.
