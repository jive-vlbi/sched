   you'll find
 
       --   A list of the subsystem's API (application programming
            interface) routines---these are the routines that may be called
            directly by SPICE-based user application code
 
       --   Computational ``recipes'' for a variety of GF applications
 
       --   Discussions of concepts essential to understanding the correct

Intended Audience
 
   This document addresses the needs of several groups of SPICE users.
   Users looking for a basic discussion the capabilities of the SPICE GF
   subsystem should read the introduction below. Users planning to write
   application code using the GF subsystem may benefit from reading the
   entire document, but in any case should read the ``GF Concepts''
   chapter.
 
   This document assumes you already have a strong understanding of SPICE
   concepts and terminology.

Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Most geometry computations performed with SPICE involve calculating
   quantities of interest---such as distances, vectors, angles, or
   orientations---for specified times. The GF subsystem solves the inverse
   problem: it finds times when specified geometric conditions are met.
 
   For example, the GF subsystem can solve the problem:
 
      Within the time interval January 1 2009 to January 1 2010,
      find the time periods when the light time corrected
      distance between the centers of the Earth and
      Moon is less than 40000 kilometers.
 
   The GF subsystem works with a small set of geometric quantities:
 
       --   Angular separation of targets as seen by a specified observer
 
       --   Coordinates of position vectors
 
       --   Coordinates of sub-observer points
 
       --   Coordinates of surface intercept points
 
       --   Instrument FOV (Field of view) visibility states (appearance of
            a specified target within an instrument FOV)
 
       --   Illumination angles
 
       --   Observer-target distance
 
       --   Observer-target range rate
 
       --   Occultation states
 
       --   Phase angle between observer and target centers with respect to
            an illumination source
 
       --   User-defined geometric quantities, either scalar functions of
            boolean functions
 
   At the highest level of the SPICE GF subsystem interface, there is a
   search subroutine for each geometric quantity. The Fortran and C SPICE
   Toolkits contain additional, lower-level routines that provide
   functionality such as support for progress reporting and interrupt
   handling. The full set of interface routines is discussed in the chapter
   titled ``GF API Routines.''
 
   All language versions of the SPICE Toolkit contain complete example
   programs in the GF module headers or corresponding HTML Reference Guide
   pages. Extensive example programs are presented at the end of this
   document.
 
   Much of the capability of the GF subsystem derives from the wide range
   of input data (particularly FK files) and input parameters it supports.
   But in many cases it may not be immediately obvious how to select or
   create the necessary SPICE kernels and how to apply the small set of GF
   API routines to accomplish a given search task. The ``GF Computational
   Recipes'' chapter below provides many short descriptions of how to use
   the GF subsystem to search for geometric events that are frequently of
   interest.
 
   Because the main function of the GF subsystem is, at its heart, solving
   equations, the details of the subsystem's behavior are more complex than
   is the case for most other SPICE subsystems. Understanding how to call
   the GF routines is not sufficient to guarantee correct results. So SPICE
   application programmers are encouraged to read the ``GF Concepts''
   chapter below.
 
 
Planned enhancements
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   NAIF expects to expand the set of supported quantities in future
   versions of the SPICE Toolkit. Planned additions include, but are not
   limited to:
 
       --   Eclipse events
 
       --   Latitude-longitude boxes
 
 
Terminology

   Throughout this document we use terms such as SPICE window, root
   finding, convergence, etc. We include brief explanations of these terms
   below.

         Boolean quantity function   A function whose range is comprised of
                                     only two values, for example 0 and 1
                                     or ``true'' and ``false.'' For GF use
                                     such a function is implemented as a
                                     routine with one independent variable
                                     (nominally time) as input and a
                                     boolean variable as output.
 
         Bounds                      Values that constrain the range of
                                     values in a specified set of numbers:
                                     A is a lower bound for a set S if no
                                     member of S is less than A; B is an
                                     upper bound for S if no member of S is
                                     greater than B. Note that bounds are
                                     not equivalent to extrema.
 
         Binary state function       See ``Boolean quantity function.''
 
         Boresight                   A vector or ray used to indicate the
                                     ``look direction'' of an instrument.
 
         Bracket                     A number X is bracketed by numbers A
                                     and B when X lies between A and B,
                                     inclusive.
 
         Closed                      An interval is ``closed'' if it
                                     contains its endpoints.
 
         Confinement window          The time window over which a GF search
                                     is to be conducted, or a SPICE window
                                     (see below) representing this time
                                     window.
 
         Converge                    A sequence of numbers converges if the
                                     sequence tends to a limit.
 
         Convergence                 The act of converging; progress toward
                                     or completion of the process of
                                     locating a root.
 
         Convergence tolerance       A GF root-finding process is
                                     considered to have found a root when
                                     the root is bracketed by upper and
                                     lower bounds that differ by no more
                                     than a specified bound called the
                                     ``convergence tolerance.''
 
         Coordinate                  A spatial parameter belonging to a
                                     coordinate system.
 
         Coordinate system           In SPICE documentation,
                                     three-dimensional ``coordinate
                                     systems'' are parameterizations of
                                     three-dimensional space: they are
                                     mappings that label each point in
                                     space using an ordered set of three
                                     spatial parameters such as (X, Y, Z)
                                     or (radius, longitude, latitude). At
                                     any point in space, the directions in
                                     which the three coordinates increase
                                     are mutually orthogonal. Put another
                                     way, the Jacobian matrices of these
                                     mappings are not orthogonal, but they
                                     do have orthogonal sets of rows and
                                     columns. (Compare to ``reference
                                     frame'' below.)
 
         Coverage                    In SPICE documentation, ``coverage''
                                     refers to the extent of data provided
                                     by a set of SPICE kernels: either the
                                     time window for which data are
                                     available, or less commonly, the set
                                     of bodies or instruments for which
                                     data are available.
 
         Coverage window             The time window over which data of
                                     interest are available, or a SPICE
                                     window (see below) representing this
                                     time window.
 
         Disjoint                    Non-intersecting. No common elements.
 
         Domain                      The set of points on which a function
                                     acts: a function ``maps'' elements of
                                     its domain to a set called the
                                     ``range'' of the function.

         Eclipse                     An object is ``eclipsed'' or ``in
                                     eclipse'' when it intersects the
                                     shadow created by the Sun and another
                                     object.
 
         Endpoints                   The boundary values of an interval on
                                     the real line. The left endpoint of an
                                     interval is its smallest value; the
                                     right endpoint is its greatest.
 
         Ephemeris object            Any entity whose position and
                                     velocity, relative to a specified
                                     center of motion, are given by an SPK
                                     file.
 
         Extended Object             Also extended body or extended target.
                                     An object of finite size; an object
                                     consisting of more than a single
                                     point. In SPICE applications, extended
                                     objects are often represented by
                                     ellipsoids.
 
         Extrema                     Plural of extremum.
 
         Extremum                    The minimum or maximum value attained
                                     by a function. See Global Extremum and
                                     Local Extremum.
 
         FOV                         Abbreviation of ``field of view.''
 
         Field of view               The spatial region that can be viewed
                                     by a remote sensing instrument, or a
                                     mathematical model of this region.
                                     Often an instrument's field of view is
                                     modeled by a cone or a pyramid having
                                     a polygonal cross section.
 
         Global extremum             A global maximum or minimum: the
                                     unique greatest or least value
                                     attained by a function. It is possible
                                     for a function to have multiple
                                     locations in its domain at which a
                                     global extremum occurs.
 
         Instrument                  In the GF setting, an instrument is
                                     usually a camera or other
                                     remote-sensing radiation detector
                                     whose orientation is given by a
                                     reference frame known to the SPICE
                                     system and which has a field of view
                                     modeled by an IK.
 
         Interrupt handler           A routine that performs an action in
                                     response to an interrupt signal, such
                                     as that generated by a user hitting
                                     the ``control Y'' key combination at a
                                     Unix command line.
 
         Inverse problem             Inverse problems entail finding times
                                     when geometric quantities take on
                                     specified values. In general, inverse
                                     problems involve finding the set S in
                                     the domain of a function such that the
                                     function maps S to a specified set.
 
         Local extremum              A local maximum or local minimum: the
                                     greatest or least value attained by a
                                     function in a neighborhood of a point
                                     in the function's domain. At a point
                                     where a local extremum of a function
                                     is attained, there is a region or
                                     ``neighborhood'' enclosing that point
                                     over which the function is bounded by
                                     that extreme value. For a local
                                     maximum, on this region, the function
                                     is no greater than the local maximum;
                                     for a local minimum, the function is
                                     no smaller. A function can have
                                     multiple local extrema.
 
         Measure                     The measure of a SPICE window is the
                                     sum of the lengths of the window's
                                     intervals. (This definition is valid
                                     because the intervals of a SPICE
                                     window are disjoint.)

         Observer                    An ephemeris object, the location of
                                     which acts as the tail of a position
                                     vector. The head of the vector is the
                                     location of another ephemeris object
                                     called the ``target.''
 
         Observer-target vector      A vector emanating from one ephemeris
                                     object (the observer) and terminating
                                     at another (the target).
 
         Occultation                 Blockage of the apparent figure of one
                                     object by another, as seen from a
                                     specified vantage point.
 
         Range                       [1] The set of values attained by a
                                     function: a function ``maps'' elements
                                     of its domain to its range. [2] The
                                     Euclidean distance between two
                                     objects, usually target and observer.
 
         Range rate                  The derivative with respect to time of
                                     the range between two objects. For GF
                                     use, the objects being an observer and
                                     a target body.
 
         Real line                   A line representing the real numbers.
                                     The real numbers include zero, all

                                     any number that's a limit of some
                                     sequence of fractions. In SPICE
                                     documentation, real numbers are
                                     restricted to those representable by
                                     the double precision floating point
                                     data type, excluding distinguished

                                     ``coordinate system'' above.)
 
         Result window               In the GF setting, a SPICE window (see
                                     below) representing the time window
                                     over which a specified geometric
                                     condition is satisfied. A result
                                     window is an output window returned by
                                     a SPICE GF API search routine.
 
         Root                        Solution of an equation; point
                                     satisfying given constraints. In the
                                     GF setting, roots are times at which
                                     state transitions of interest occur,
                                     for example times when a specified
                                     occultation starts or stops, or the
                                     time at which the distance between two
                                     ephemeris objects attains a local
                                     minimum. Roots are endpoints of SPICE
                                     windows representing search results.
 
         Root Finding                The process of locating roots;
                                     searching for roots.
 
         Scalar quantity function    A function that returns a scalar
                                     value. For GF use such a function is
                                     implemented as a routine with one
                                     independent variable (nominally time)
                                     as input and the scalar variable as
                                     output.

                                     SCLK'' tutorial and the SCLK Required

         Search window               A confinement window (see above).
 
         Singleton                   A set consisting of a single point.
                                     Also short for ``singleton interval.''
 
         Singleton interval          An interval having equal left and
                                     right endpoints.
 
         Singularity                 A point or region in the domain of a
                                     function at which the function is
                                     ``badly behaved'': the function is not
                                     defined, not continuous, or not
                                     differentiable. For example, longitude
                                     has a singularity at pi radians. In
                                     three dimensional space the singular
                                     region of longitude is the half-plane
                                     for which Y = 0 and X <= 0.
 
         SPICE window                Also SPICELIB window. An abstract data
                                     type used to represent collections of
                                     intervals on the real line, especially
                                     collections of time intervals; also,
                                     an instance of this type. A SPICE
                                     window represents a union of zero or
                                     more disjoint intervals, arranged in
                                     increasing order: the right endpoint
                                     of one constituent interval of a
                                     window is strictly less than the left
                                     endpoint of the next interval.
                                     Intervals in a SPICE window may be
                                     singletons. SPICE window can be empty.
                                     SPICE windows are implemented as
                                     structured arrays in Fortran and
                                     MATLAB; they're implemented as
                                     structures in C and IDL. See the
                                     Windows Required Reading, windows.req,

                                     the user's specification, either
                                     closest to the observer, or lies on
                                     the line connecting the observer and
                                     the target's center.
 
         Surface intercept           An intersection of a ray and a
                                     specified surface. When the vertex of
                                     the ray is associated with an
                                     observer, usually the surface
                                     intercept is understood to be the
                                     point of intersection closest to the
                                     observer.
 
         Target                      Ephemeris object, the location of
                                     which acts as the head of a position
                                     vector. The tail of the vector is the
                                     location of another ephemeris object
                                     called the ``observer.''

GF Concepts
===========================================================================
 
 
Time windows
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Every GF search is performed over a time period represented by a SPICE
   window called the ``confinement window.'' Every successful GF search
   produces as a result a SPICE window called the ``result window.''
 
   In SPICE documentation, a ``time window'' is a set of zero or more
   closed, disjoint time intervals, arranged in increasing order. The
   intervals may be singletons: they can have equal left and right
   endpoints.
 
   The term ``SPICE window'' refers to both the abstract data type used to
   represent time windows and instances of this type. In Fortran and
   MATLAB, SPICE windows are implemented via structured arrays (arrays
   whose internal organization adheres to certain rules); in C and IDL they
   are represented by structures.
 
   By ``closed'' we mean that the intervals of a SPICE window are
   topologically closed: that is, the intervals always include their
   endpoints.
 
   We'll use diagrams like the one below to depict time windows. The dashed
   line represents the real line; the bracketed regions signify the time
   intervals comprising the window.
 
      --[----------------------]-------[----]--[----------------]--
 
 
Window manipulation and arithmetic
 
   The SPICE Toolkit provides a set of routines that manipulate SPICE
   windows. These are described in the Windows Required Reading
   windows.req. Among the supported window operations are ``set
   arithmetic'' functions such as union, intersection, difference, and
   complementing with respect to an interval.
 
   Arithmetic on SPICE windows differs a bit from standard set arithmetic
   because all windows resulting from window operations remain closed. For
   example, when you subtract a SPICE window from another, the result is a
   union of closed intervals. Standard set arithmetic would produce a
   result containing half-open or open intervals.
 
   Window arithmetic is used to solve for logical combinations of geometric
   conditions. For example:
 
       --   To find times within a given confinement window when a target
            is not occulted, use GFOCLT to find the times when the target
            is occulted, then subtract the result window from the
            confinement window.
 
       --   To find times when a target is visible in either of the FOVs of
            two instruments, conduct visibility searches for each
            instrument using GFTFOV, then compute the union of the result
            windows from the two searches.
 
   It is often convenient to use the result window produced by one GF
   search as the input confinement window of another. Often this is both
   simpler and faster than computing two searches on the original
   confinement window and then intersecting the result windows.
 
 
Result windows are approximate
 
   Since result windows are created by a mathematical root finding process,
   the endpoints---that is, the start and stop times---of the intervals
   comprising these windows are always approximate. The errors in these
   endpoint times are due not only to errors in input data and round-off
   errors introduced by finite-precision arithmetic, but to the fact that
   the endpoints are determined by an approximation process that terminates
   when the endpoints are found to be correct within a ``convergence
   tolerance.''
 
   A consequence of the errors in the computed endpoints is that the
   geometric constraint that is supposed to be satisfied for every time
   within the result window FREQUENTLY IS NOT SATISFIED at one or more
   endpoints of the intervals of this window. In fact, it is common for
   there to be a small time region surrounding an interval endpoint on
   which the constraint of interest is not satisfied.
 
   For the same reason, it is just as likely that the constraint of
   interest is satisfied on a small time region extending beyond an
   interval endpoint of the result window. This is perhaps a less obvious
   error, but it is nevertheless an error because the result window is
   ideally the exact set of times, within the confinement window, on which
   the constraint is satisfied. In this case the result window is not the
   maximal subset of the confinement window on which the constraint is
   satisfied.
 
   One application for which result window errors are particularly striking
   is that of searches for time windows satisfying longitude or right
   ascension constraints. For example, a small error in the window over
   which a given longitude is between -180 and -150 degrees can easily
   include some times at which the longitude is between 179 and 180
   degrees.
 
 
Working around result window errors
 
   SPICE window ``contraction'' is an operation in which the left endpoints
   of each of a window's intervals are moved to the right and the right
   endpoints are moved to the left. Use the SPICE routine WNCOND to
   contract a SPICE window.
 
   In many cases, it makes sense to contract a result window slightly to
   remove portions of the window on which a constraint is not satisfied.
   Usually it suffices to contract a window by an amount on the order of
   the convergence tolerance. In the case of result windows produced by
   longitude or right ascension searches, a somewhat larger contraction is
   needed because these result windows are actually the product of multiple
   sub-searches.
 
   When an application performs set arithmetic on result windows, usually
   contraction should be performed only on the final result. Contracting
   intermediate results can be a mistake. For example, contracting a window
   before computing its complement introduces an error in the complement:
   the complement then includes more of the original window than just its
   endpoints.
 
   Contraction should not be performed on result windows comprised of
   singleton intervals: the result of such contractions would be an empty
   window. Searches for local or absolute extrema are examples of the type
   that produces a window of singleton intervals.
 
 
Events
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In GF documentation, an instance of a geometric quantity satisfying a
   specified condition is called an ``event.'' An event can be
   instantaneous, such as an observer attaining its minimum distance to a
   target, or it can have finite duration, as does an occultation.
 
   Geometric quantities supported by the GF subsystem either have binary
   states or are numeric functions of time.
 
   ``Binary state'' quantities are logical-valued functions of time;
   they're either true or false for a given time value. For example,
   ``target A is fully occulted by target B as seen from observer C'' is
   either true or false at any given time. Occultation and FOV visibility
   are binary state quantities.
 
   ``Numeric'' quantities are scalar-valued functions of time. Distance,
   angular separation, and coordinates are numeric quantities.
 
 
Constraints
 
   Constraints are logical conditions that are specified by a calling
   SPICE-based application and satisfied over the result window produced by
   a GF search.
 
   The only supported constraint applicable to binary state quantities is
   ``the state is true." Note that SPICE window arithmetic serves to
   produce the window on which a binary state is false.
 
   Supported constraints on numeric quantities are mathematical relations,
   such as equalities, inequalities, and attainment of local or global
   maxima or minima. These are often called ``numeric constraints''
   ``scalar constraints,'' or ``relational constraints.'' Specifically,
   these relations are:
 
         =                           The quantity is equal to a specified
                                     value, called the ``reference value.'
 
         <                           The quantity is less than a specified
                                     value, called the ``reference value.'
 
         >                           The quantity is greater than a
                                     specified value, called the
                                     ``reference value.'
 
         ABSMAX                      The quantity attains its absolute
                                     (global) maximum.
 
         ABSMIN                      The quantity attains its absolute
                                     (global) minimum.
 
         LOCMAX                      The quantity attains a local maximum.
 
         LOCMIN                      The quantity attains a local minimum.
 
         ABSMAX, ADJUST !=0          The quantity is within the adjustment
                                     amount ADJUST of its absolute (global)
                                     maximum.
 
         ABSMIN, ADJUST !=0          The quantity is within the adjustment
                                     amount ADJUST of its absolute (global)
                                     minimum.
 
   For a numeric quantity search, the result window is the set of times at
   which the quantity satisfies the specified relation.
 
   Note that the ``greater than or equal to (>=)'' and ``less than or equal
   to (<=)'' operators are not supported. Since result windows are
   approximate, the distinction between the solutions that could be found
   using these operators and those found using strict inequality operators
   is usually not meaningful. The case where there is a significant
   distinction is that in which a function takes on the constant value X on
   one or more intervals, and the reference value is set to X. However, as
   discussed below, the GF subsystem cannot solve for this constraint.
 
 
Root finding
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   A search for a specified event comes down to finding the start and stop
   times of the intervals, within a given confinement window, over which
   the event occurs---that is, over which the geometric quantity of
   interest satisfies a constraint specified by the calling application.
   These start and stop times are the ``roots'' found by a GF search.
 
   Because GF searches are ``global'' in the sense that they attempt to
   find all roots within the confinement window, each search involves two
   basic steps: bracketing the roots and refining the roots.
 
   Note that the most elementary root finding techniques deal with finding
   roots that are already bracketed.
 
   Searches for roots are conducted independently over each interval
   comprising the confinement window. For simplicity, and without loss of
   generality, we'll describe the processes below for confinement windows
   consisting of a single interval.
 
 
Search step size
 
   Root bracketing consists of sampling the geometric quantity of interest
   at evenly spaced times throughout an interval.
 
   An example is shown below: we have a confinement window consisting of an
   interval having a start time of 2 seconds past J2000 TDB, a stop time of
   57 seconds past J2000 TDB, and a step size of 10 TDB seconds.
 
   Sampling with 10-second step:
 
 
        2         12        22        32        42        52   57
        |         |         |         |         |         |    |
        v         v         v         v         v         v    v
 
      --[------------------------------------------------------]---
        ^                                                      ^
        2                                                      57
 
   Note that a sample is always taken at the end of the interval.
 
   The reader may note that the unlikely TDB time values used here
   correspond to the zero-based column counts of the dashes in the diagram.
 
   Suppose the quantity we're sampling is of the binary-state variety. Each
   sample has the value ``true'' or ``false.'' Suppose the diagram below
   indicates the state of the quantity as a function of time. At the top of
   the diagram are the values of the state samples:
 
        F         T         T         T         F         F    F
 
        2         12        22        32        42        52   57
        |         |         |         |         |         |    |
        v         v         v         v         v         v    v
 
           TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
        FFF                                    FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
 
      --[------------------------------------------------------]---
        ^                                                      ^
        2                                                      57
 
   Above, the samples indicate that state transitions must occur between
   the times 2 and 12 TDB seconds past J2000 TDB, and also between 32 and
   42 seconds past J2000 TDB. So these pairs of times bracket,
   respectively, the start and stop times of our ``event.''
 
   Given the bracketing times, the GF system can refine the actual times of
   the state transitions, producing estimates that are accurate to within a
   given convergence tolerance.
 
 
Binary state step size selection problems
 
   It's clear that for most searches, choosing an extremely small step size
   will result in a large number of samples being taken. This will result
   in very---probably unacceptably---slow search execution.
 
   Step sizes that are too large may result in fast search completion, but
   they'll produce erroneous results.
 
   As an example, suppose we repeat the previous search using a 40 second
   step. The samples we'd find are shown below.
 
        F                                       F              F
 
        2                                       42             57
        |                                       |              |
        v                                       v              v
 
           TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
        FFF                                    FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
 
      --[------------------------------------------------------]---
        ^                                                      ^
        2                                                      57
 
   Above, the samples indicate that no state transitions occur: the state
   is always ``false.'' The GF subsystem will fail to detect the event and
   will return an empty result window.
 
   Another example: suppose we use a 10 second step size and our binary
   state quantity has the profile shown below:
 
        F         T         T         T         T         F    F
 
        2         12        22        32        42        52   57
        |         |         |         |         |         |    |
        v         v         v         v         v         v    v
 
           TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT       TTTTTTTTTTTTTT
        FFF                   FFFFFFF              FFFFFFFFFFFFF
 
      --[------------------------------------------------------]---
        ^                                                      ^
        2                                                      57
 
   Above, the samples indicate that state transitions must occur between
   the times 2 and 12 TDB seconds past J2000 TDB, and also between 42 and
   52 seconds past J2000 TDB. The GF subsystem thinks that only one long
   event has occurred because the state transitions in the middle of the
   search interval were missed.
 
   We can conclude that for binary state searches, the step size must be
   short enough to capture the relevant behavior of the underlying
   geometric quantity: the step size must be shorter than any event of
   interest, and it must be shorter than any gap between events of
   interest.
 
 
Numeric quantity step size selection problems
 
   The step size issues discussed above apply to numeric quantity searches
   as well, because each numeric quantity search involves a binary state
   search to determine times, within the confinement window, when the
   quantity is decreasing. The state transition times found by this search
   are times when local extrema are attained.
 
   So for numeric quantity searches, the step size must be small enough so
   that all (relevant) local extrema can be found: the step size must be
   smaller than the minimum time between consecutive epochs at which local
   extrema of the numeric quantity occur.
 
 
Search convergence
 
   Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to narrow
   down the time interval, [t1, t2] with t2 >= t1, within which the root
   must lie. This refinement process terminates when the location of the
   root has been determined to within an error margin called then
   "convergence tolerance."
 
   The high-level GF search routines use a fixed tolerance in units of
   seconds CNVTOL which is defined in the include file
 
      gf.inc
 
   The default value is "tight" so that the tolerance doesn't become the
   limiting factor in the accuracy of solutions. In general the accuracy of
   input data will be the limiting factor.
 
   To use a different tolerance value, mid-level GF search routines
   (available only in the Fortran and C SPICE Toolkits) must be called.
   Making the tolerance tighter than the default is unlikely to be useful,
   since the results are unlikely to be more accurate. Making the tolerance
   looser will speed up searches somewhat, since a few convergence steps
   will be omitted. However, in most cases, the step size is likely to have
   a much greater effect on processing time than would the convergence
   tolerance.
 
   Please remember the condition satisfying convergence
 
      || t2 - t1 || =< CNVTOL
 
   does not imply (ignoring incompatibility of units)
 
      || f(t2) - f(t1) || =< CNVTOL
 
   for scalar function ``f(t).'' The GF subsystem measures convergence
   using time (units of TDB seconds) not using the scalar quantity (units
   of kilometers or radians or whatever).
 
 
An important numeric event limitation
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The algorithm currently used by the GF subsystem to search for numeric
   events makes a very strong assumption about the underlying numeric
   quantities:
 
      Each numeric quantity is piecewise monotone.
 
   That is, each interval of the confinement window can be divided into a
   finite set of intervals over which the quantity is always increasing or
   always decreasing.
 
   The authors believe this is a reasonable assumption for most numeric
   quantities involving solar system geometry.
 
   However, this not a valid assumption for all numeric quantities
   supported by SPICE. For example, spacecraft orientation definitely can,
   and often does, violate this assumption.
 
   There are two practical consequences of this assumption:
 
       --   The GF subsystem cannot correctly solve for times when the
            numeric quantity of interest takes on a constant value X, if
            the quantity takes on the value X over a finite (non singleton)
            interval. The GF subsystem can solve for equality constraints
            only when the solution consists of a finite set of points.
 
       --   Searches for local extrema may yield extraneous solutions if
            the numeric quantity of interest is constant on a finite (non
            singleton) interval. If the search step size is shorter than
            such an interval, and if the quantity exhibits any noise (such
            as that caused by round-off errors), then at least one local
            extremum will be found in the interval.
 
   GF users must consider the impact of this assumption on the validity of
   planned GF applications.
 
 
Workspace
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   GF scalar quantity searches require memory to store intermediate
   results; this memory is called ``workspace.'' Note that GF binary state
   searches don't require workspace.
 
   Workspace is used to store multiple SPICE windows, all of which have the
   same size. The windows' size requirement is determined by the number of
   time intervals they must be able to hold.
 
   GF users decide the amount of workspace to provide: in Fortran, callers
   of the GF search API routines declare workspace arrays, while GF APIs of
   SPICE Toolkits for other languages dynamically allocate memory based on
   the workspace window interval count specified by calling applications
   via an input argument.
 
 
Workspace window counts
 
   Fortran SPICE Toolkit users must declare workspace using two dimensions:
   workspace window size and workspace window count---the count is the
   number of windows the workspace can hold. Parameters giving recommended
   workspace window counts are declared in the SPICELIB include file
 
      gf.inc
 
   Declaring workspace window counts to be larger than the actual required
   number is not an error.
 
   Readers may note that the SPICELIB GF interfaces could have relied on
   hard-coded workspace window counts. The reason for treating these counts
   as passed-in parameters is that this enables run-time error checking on
   the counts.
 
   SPICE Toolkits implemented in languages other than Fortran handle
   workspace window counts automatically. However, users of these Toolkits
   may wish to be aware of these window count requirements because they
   affect the total amount of dynamically allocated memory used by the GF
   API routines. Parameters giving workspace window counts are declared in
   the CSPICE header file
 
      SpiceGF.h
 
 
Workspace window interval counts
 
   While workspace window count requirements are determined by parameters,
   maximum workspace window interval counts must be selected by SPICE
   users.
 
   For most searches, it's safe to choose a workspace interval count that's
   much larger than the actual requirement. For example, one can choose an
   interval count of 200000 for a search that really requires only 200
   intervals. This approach is used in most GF example programs that appear
   in SPICE documentation.
 
   The only drawback to the approach of picking a large, default workspace
   size is that if it's taken to extremes, applications may use so much
   memory so that they fail to link or run, or so that they run
   inefficiently.
 
   If an initial guess at the workspace size requirement fails, one usually
   can simply increase the workspace size and repeat the search.
 
   However, some applications call for a more accurate method of estimating
   workspace interval count requirements. The actual requirement is that
   the interval count must be large enough to hold the windows, restricted
   to the confinement interval, over which the quantity of interest is
   monotonically increasing or decreasing. Note that the number of
   intervals comprising the confinement window affects the amount of
   required space.
 
 
Estimating the workspace interval count requirement
 
   If a confinement window is comprised of N intervals and has measure M
   seconds, and the search step size is STEP seconds, then a rule of thumb
   for the number of required workspace intervals NINTVLS is
 
      NINTVLS  =  2*N  +  ( M / STEP )
 
   In many cases the actual number of intervals needed is much smaller than
   this estimate.
 
 
GF API Routines
===========================================================================
 
 
High-level GF search routines
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The high-level GF search routines constitute the principal application
   programming interface to the GF subsystem.
 
   The routines described here are supported in all language versions of
   the SPICE Toolkit.
 
   All of the routines listed below have extensive header documentation.
   Each header describes all input and output arguments and includes one or
   more example programs accompanied by example meta-kernels and
   corresponding program outputs.
 
   Additional, more extensive code examples are presented at the end of
   this document.
 
   The ``GF Computational Recipes'' chapter below provides hints on how to
   solve various geometric search problems using these routines.
 
   The high-level GF search routines are:
 
         GFDIST   Distance search: find time windows when a given
                  observer-target distance constraint is met.
 
         GFILUM   Illumination angles: find time window over which a
                  constraint on the observed phase, solar incidence, or
                  emission angle at a specified target body surface point
                  is met.
 
         GFOCLT   Occultation or transit search: find time windows when a
                  given type of occultation or transit is in progress.
 
         GFPA     Phase angle: find time windows when a
                  observer-target-illuminator phase angle constraint is
                  met.
 
         GFPOSC   Observer-target position vector coordinate search: find
                  time windows when a given constraint on a specified
                  coordinate (e.g. Cartesian X, Y, Z or planetocentric
                  radius, longitude, or latitude) of an observer-target
                  position vector is met.
 
         GFRFOV   Ray in instrument field of view search: find time windows
                  when a given ray emanating from an observer is contained
                  in a specified instrument's field of view.
 
         GFRR     Range rate: find time windows when a given constraint on
                  the range rate of an observer to target position vector
                  is met.
 
         GFSEP    Angular separation search: find time windows when a given
                  constraint on the angular separation of two targets as
                  seen by a specified observer is met.
 
         GFSNTC   Ray-surface intercept coordinate search: find time
                  windows when a specified constraint on a coordinate of
                  the surface intercept of a specified ray on a target body
                  is met.
 
         GFSTOL   Set the GF subsystem convergence tolerance. The high
                  level GF routines use the default tolerance for the
                  search. The user may change the convergence tolerance
                  from the default value by calling GFSTOL. All subsequent
                  searches using the high level routines will use the
                  updated tolerance value.
 
         GFSUBC   Sub-observer point coordinate search: find time windows
                  when a specified constraint on a coordinate of the
                  sub-observer point on a specified target body is met.
 
         GFTFOV   Target body in instrument field of view search: find time
                  windows when a given target body appears in a specified
                  instrument's field of view.
 
         GFUDB    User-defined boolean quantity function: find time windows
                  when a given user-defined boolean value function equals
                  true.
 
         GFUDS    User-defined scalar quantity function: find time windows
                  when a given constraint on a user-defined scalar value
                  function is met.
 
 
Mid-level GF search routines
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The routines discussed here are provided only in the Fortran and C SPICE
   Toolkits. (Practical means of implementing these routines in IDL and
   MATLAB have not been found.)
 
   The mid-level GF search routines are:
 
         GFEVNT   Scalar quantity search: find times when specified
                  constraints on any scalar quantity, such as distance or
                  angular separation, are met.
 
         GFFOVE   FOV search: find times when a specified target appears in
                  a specified instrument FOV. This routine provides the
                  functionality of both GFTFOV and GFRFOV.
 
         GFOCCE   Occultation or transit search: find times when a
                  specified target body occults or is in transit across
                  another, as seen by a specified observer.
 
   These routines provide all of the functionality of the high-level search
   routines, plus several additional features:
 
         Progress reporting          Applications can control whether a
                                     ``percent complete'' progress report
                                     is displayed during a GF search. By
                                     default, the report is displayed via
                                     console I/O. Applications can override
                                     the default display by passing custom
                                     progress reporting routines as input
                                     arguments to mid-level GF search
                                     routines.
 
         Interrupt handling          Applications can control whether
                                     mid-level GF search routines test for
                                     issuance of an interrupt command and
                                     abort if such a command is detected.
                                     Due to the lack of interrupt handling
                                     support in ANSI standard Fortran 77,
                                     applications can make use of this
                                     capability only by passing a custom
                                     (non-standard) interrupt detection
                                     routine as an input argument to
                                     mid-level GF search routines.
 
         Set search step function    Applications can override the default
                                     search step behavior by passing a
                                     custom step size routine as an input
                                     argument to mid-level GF search
                                     routines.
 
         Set refinement function     Applications can override the default
                                     root refinement algorithm (binary
                                     search) by passing a custom root
                                     refinement routine as an input
                                     argument to mid-level GF search
                                     routines.
 
         Set convergence tolerance   Convergence tolerance is an input
                                     argument to mid-level GF search
                                     routines.
 
 
Rationale for calling mid-level GF search routines
 
   The mid-level GF search routines are more complex than their high-level
   counterparts (considerably so in the case of GFEVNT). The main reason to
   use the mid-level routines is to take advantage of their progress
   reporting and interrupt handling capabilities.
 
   GF searches can take a long time to complete, particularly when the
   confinement window is large and the step size is small. It may not be
   obvious to a user whether a running search is making progress at a
   reasonable rate. The default GF progress report, which when enabled
   updates approximately once per second, helps to answer this question.
 
   If progress reporting is used in a GUI application, reports produced by
   the default mechanism are probably undesirable. In this case,
   application programs can pass custom progress reporting routines to the
   mid-level GF search routines.
 
   When an interactive SPICE-based application runs a GF search, the user
   may want to abort the search without terminating the program, possibly
   because terminating the program would result in substantial loss of
   work. The GF interrupt handling capability allows an application program
   to quickly abort GF searches and have the GF system return control to
   the application.
 
 
Supporting utility routines
 
   When the default GF progress reporting, interrupt handling, and
   root-finding functionality is desired, a calling application can call
   existing GF utility routines and, where applicable, pass them as actual
   input arguments to the mid-level search routines. These utilities are:
 
         GFSSTP   Set search step. This routine sets the step size that
                  will be returned by GFSTEP.
 
         GFSTEP   Get search step. This routine returns step size that was
                  last set by GFSSTP.
 
         GFREFN   Refine root bracketing interval. This routine returns the
                  midpoint of the input times; this behavior supports root
                  finding by bisection.
 
         GFREPI   Initialize progress report.
 
         GFREPU   Update progress report.
 
         GFREPF   Finalize progress report.
 
         GFBAIL   Detect interrupt. This function returns a logical value
                  indicating whether an interrupt has been detected.
 
   Since ANSI standard Fortran 77 (unlike ANSI C) doesn't provide support
   for interrupt handling, the SPICELIB function GFBAIL is a placeholder;
   SPICELIB users must override this function with their own custom routine
   to implement interrupt handling.
 
 
Overriding default behavior
 
   Progress Reporting
 
   To override the default progress reporting capability provided by the
   mid-level GF search routines, an application must pass in custom
   routines in place of GFREPI, GRREPU, and GFREPF. Each of the custom
   routines must have an argument list that exactly matches that of the
   default routine it overrides; see the headers of the default routines
   for details. These routines are entry points in the umbrella routine
   GFRPRT. Note that the application must override all of the progress
   reporting routines in a given call, if it overrides any one of them.
 
   To override the default interrupt handling capability, an application
   must pass in a custom routine in place of GFBAIL. The custom routine
   must have an argument list that exactly matches that of GFBAIL.
 
   Step Size and Refinement Functions
 
   The need to override the step size and refinement functions is expected
   to be quite unusual; it should be attempted only by programmers having a
   detailed knowledge of the GF search algorithms and the code that
   implements them.
 
 
GF Computational Recipes
===========================================================================
 
   Below we provide terse descriptions of computational approaches for
   solving common geometric search problems.
 
   The ``recipes'' below are very abbreviated; they're intended to be
   helpful to experienced SPICE users. New users are encouraged to first
   familiarize themselves with the example programs in the GF API headers
   and in this document.
 
   Users should consult the headers of the pertinent SPICE routines for
   details on the use of those routines.
 
   Note that for valid comparison of GF results against those obtained by
   alternate means, inputs such as kernel data, aberration corrections,
   reference frames, coordinate systems, confinement windows, and time
   systems used to represent time windows must be compatible.
 
 
Required SPICE kernels
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   With a few exceptions, the recipes below don't discuss the SPICE kernels
   required to carry out the described computations. Some general
   requirements are summarized here:
 
       --   SPK files containing ephemeris data for targets and observers
            are almost always required; the only exception is the star
            visibility case where the star's location is modeled as a
            direction rather than as a position vector.
 
            When aberration corrections are used, sufficient ephemeris data
            must be available to propagate states of the observer and
            targets to the solar system barycenter. The states of the
            targets must be calculable at light time corrected epochs, so
            the required coverage will extend beyond the confinement
            window.
 
            When stellar aberration corrections are used, coverage for the
            observer must be available on a window whose intervals are
            expanded by one second (in both directions) relative to the
            confinement window.
 
       --   Computations involving target body-fixed, body-centered
            reference frames require PCK files providing orientation data
            for those reference frames. Such computations often require PCK
            files containing size and shape data for the target body as
            well. In many cases one PCK file can provide both the necessary
            orientation and size/shape data.
 
            When required body-fixed, body-centered reference frame
            specifications are not built into the SPICE system, those
            specifications must be provided by FK files.
 
       --   Computations involving topocentric reference frames centered at
            surface points on extended objects require both SPK and FK
            files providing state data for the surface point and
            topocentric frame orientation, respectively. Usually these
            computations also require a PCK file providing orientation of
            the extended object.
 
       --   Computations involving instrument pointing and FOV
            specifications normally require all of the following: CK files,
            SCLK kernels, LSK files, FK files, and IK files.
 
 
A note about CK data availability
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   CK files, particularly those containing reconstructed attitude data,
   often have coverage gaps. A SPICE-based application program can obtain
   the time window over which CK data are available by calling the SPICE
   routine CKCOV.
 
   When the caller of CKCOV requests that interval endpoints in the CK
   coverage time window be expressed as TDB seconds, CKCOV must convert
   these endpoints from encoded SCLK (ticks) to TDB. Due to round-off
   errors, and in some cases, to discontinuities in the TDB-to-ticks
   mapping, the TDB values obtained via this call may not be translatable
   to tick values within the actual coverage window of the CK file.
 
   For safety, applications obtaining TDB coverage windows via CKCOV should
   call the SPICE window routine WNCOND to contract those windows by a
   duration large enough to ensure that the entire, contracted coverage
   window is usable.
 
   For an SCLK kernel that provides a continuous TDB-to-ticks mapping, a
   contraction duration (having units of TDB seconds) equivalent to one
   tick normally should suffice, as long as the nominal tick duration is at
   least one microsecond.
 
   For SCLK kernels having discontinuities, the required contraction
   duration can be determined by analyzing the possible mapping errors
   caused by those discontinuities; alternatively, it can be determined by
   trial and error. If a search is performed and required CK data are
   unavailable, SPICE routines will signal an error.
 
 
Geometric constraint searches
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Periapse/Apoapse
 
   To find the unique closest approach of an observer to a target over a
   specified time window, call GFDIST, specifying the
 
      'ABSMIN'
 
   (absolute minimum) relational operator. To find all of the ``close
   approaches'' of an observer to a target over a specified time window,
   use the
 
      'LOCMIN'
 
   (local minimum) relational operator.
 
   For apoapse events, use the absolute or local maximum operators instead:
 
      'ABSMAX'
      'LOCMAX'
 
   See the example program MEDLEY below for details.
 
 
View periods
 
   View periods may be defined as time intervals, within a confinement
   window, during which a target body has elevation greater than a
   specified limit with respect to the local horizontal plane at a given
   point on the surface of an extended body.
 
   Compute view periods using GFPOSC. See the example program MEDLEY below
   for details.
 
   In the GFPOSC call, aberration corrections should be set to be
   compatible with the direction of radiation travel: either ``reception''
   or ``transmission'' corrections can be selected. Normally both light
   time and stellar aberration corrections should be used; the aberration
   correction input string should be either of
 
      'LT+S'
      'XLT+S'
 
   To find the time window when the target is ``visible'' for both
   reception and transmission, run the search twice, using both aberration
   correction choices. The result window from the first search can be used
   as the confinement window for the second.
 
   SPICE doesn't have the capability of modeling atmospheric effects, so
   for observers on bodies having atmospheres, view periods found using the
   GF subsystem will be subject to errors due to this deficiency.
 
   ``Usable'' view periods may be a subset of those found by GF searches,
   since there may be pointing limitations on the antenna or instrument
   viewing the target.
 
 
Sub-observer point
 
   Use GFSUBC to find times when the sub-observer point on an extended
   target satisfies the constraints
 
      min_lon < sub-observer longitude < max_lon
      min_lat < sub-observer latitude  < max_lat
 
   Four searches are required: one for each constraint.
 
   The searches can be cascaded: the result window for one search can be
   used as the confinement window for the next.
 
   If the longitude interval of interest includes 180 degrees, then
 
            min_lon > max_lon
 
   and the corresponding longitude constraints have the form
 
            min_lon < sub-observer longitude
      OR    max_lon > sub-observer longitude
 
   In this case the solution window for the longitude constraints is the
   union of the solution windows for the two constraints shown above; use
   WNUNID to compute this union. The union can then be used as the
   confinement window for a latitude search.
 
   The case of a right ascension interval containing 0 degrees is handled
   analogously.
 
   The order of the searches can be important: often constraints on one of
   the coordinates produce a smaller result window than constraints on the
   other. For example, for a polar orbiter, latitude constraints may be
   satisfied over a small fraction of the search window, so searching for
   times when the latitude constraints are met would yield a small window
   over which the longitude searches would be conducted. For an equatorial
   orbiter, the situation would be reversed.
 
 
Instrument boresight intercept
 
   Use GFSNTC to find times when the intercept on an extended target body
   of a ray emanating from an observing instrument's location and aligned
   with the instrument's boresight satisfies the constraints
 
      min_lon < intercept longitude < max_lon
      min_lat < intercept latitude  < max_lat
 
   Four searches are required: one for each constraint.
 
   See the discussion of alternate longitude constraints and of search
   order above in the section titled ``Sub-observer point.''
 
   Note that pointing stability can be an issue for boresight intercept
   searches: the pointing must be stable enough so that the GF system can
   compute the time window, within the confinement window, during which the
   ray-surface intercept exists. High-frequency pointing excursions can
   cause this ``existence window'' computation to produce invalid results,
   which in turn will cause the requested coordinate constraint searches to
   either fail before completion or to complete but produce invalid
   results.
 
   GFSNTC should not be used for near-tangent ray direction cases. GFSNTC
   contracts the existence window described above by a fraction of a second
   to avoid geometric singularities; this affords more robust search
   behavior for normal cases but prevents GFSNTC from producing accurate
   results for near-tangent ray pointing.
 
 
Planet in instrument field of view
 
   Use GFTFOV to find times when an ephemeris object is in the FOV of an
   instrument, provided this FOV can be modeled as one of the shapes
   supported by the SPICE routine GETFOV. The target shape can be treated
   as an ellipsoid or a point.
 
   GFTFOV may not be suitable for FOV searches involving push-broom
   cameras. For an alternate approach, see the example program ROVER below
   for a demonstration of a search involving the MRO HIRISE camera.
 
 
Star in instrument field of view
 
   Use GFRFOV to find times when a target modeled as a ray (that is, the
   direction to the target is available, the distance to the target is not)
   is in the FOV of an instrument, provided this FOV can be modeled as one
   of the shapes supported by the SPICE routine GETFOV.
 
 
Spacecraft occultation or transit
 
   Use GFOCLT to search for spacecraft occultations or transits. If the
   spacecraft is the target, the spacecraft shape can be modeled as a
   point. The blocking body must be modeled as an ellipsoid.
 
   GFOCLT assumes straight-line light paths for occultation searches. This
   assumption may not be suitable for high-accuracy work.
 
 
Natural satellite occultation or transit
 
   Use GFOCLT to search for natural satellite occultations or transits.
   Both satellite and planet should be modeled as ellipsoids.
 
 
Spacecraft eclipse
 
   Defining a spacecraft eclipse as the presence of the spacecraft in the
   shadow created by the Sun and a blocking body, one can observe that
   eclipses are equivalent to occultations, where the spacecraft is the
   observer, the Sun is the ``back'' body, and the blocking body is the
   ``front'' body.
 
   Use GFOCLT to search for spacecraft eclipses.
 
   Both the Sun and the blocking body should be modeled as ellipsoids.
 
   Set the occultation type to
 
      'ANY'
 
   to search for times when the spacecraft is in penumbral or umbral
   eclipse; set the occultation type to
 
      'FULL'
 
   to search for times when the spacecraft is in umbral eclipse.
 
   GFOCLT assumes straight-line light paths for occultation searches. This
   assumption may not be suitable for high-accuracy work.
 
 
Surface point eclipse
 
   Searches for eclipses of a surface point on an extended object can be
   conducted using GFOCLT, as long as the position of the surface point is
   given by an SPK file. Use the SPICE utility PINPOINT to create an SPK
   file for the surface point if necessary; then proceed as described in
   the above ``Spacecraft eclipse'' discussion.
 
 
Equator crossing
 
   Use GFPOSC to find times when one body crosses the equatorial plane of
   another.
 
   The reference frame should be the body-fixed, body-centered frame
   associated with the body whose equatorial plane is of interest.
 
   The coordinate system and coordinate can be set, respectively, to
 
      'RECTANGULAR'
      'Z'
 
   Use the relational description "Z = 0" for the search.
 
   Other choices such as
 
      'LATITUDINAL'
      'LATITUDE'
 
   will yield the same results, up to round-off errors.
 
   Use the relational description "LATITUDE = 0" for the search.
 
   Note that for a given pair of bodies, when aberration corrections are
   used, the choice of observer and target affects the result, since
   aberration corrections are not anti-symmetric functions of target and
   observer.
 
   See the Fundamental Concepts SPICE tutorial and the header of SPKEZR for
   further information on aberration corrections.
 
 
Meridian crossing
 
   Use GFPOSC to find times when one body crosses a given meridian of the
   body-fixed, body-centered reference frame of another.
 
   Care must be taken to identify the appropriate coordinate system: is
   longitude positive East or positive West?
 
   For the positive East longitude case, the coordinate system and
   coordinate can be set to
 
      'LATITUDINAL'
      'LONGITUDE'
 
   respectively.
 
   For the positive West longitude case, planetographic longitude can be
   used, but in some cases, additional set-up is required.
 
   If the central body is not the Earth, Moon, Sun, or a body with
   retrograde spin, the selections
 
      'PLANETOGRAPHIC'
      'LONGITUDE'
 
   can be used as is.
 
   Use the relational description "LONGITUDE = value" for the search, where
   value is the angular value for the meridian, expressed in radians.
 
   The Earth, Moon, Sun, and bodies with retrograde spin are special cases,
   because for these objects planetographic longitude is positive East by
   default. However, this default can be overridden via kernel pool
   assignments: an application can force planetographic longitude for a
   given body to increase in the desired sense. See the header of RECPGR
   for details. If these assignments are made, then the above choices of
   coordinate system and coordinate will work for these special cases as
   well.
 
   See the notes on aberration corrections in the section titled ``Equator
   crossing'' above.
 
 
Elongation
 
   Use GFSEP to find times when target body elongation constraints are met,
   given a target body and observer. The Sun is the second target.
 
 
Orbital longitude of a satellite
 
   This recipe requires the user to create two dynamic reference frame
   specifications in a frame kernel. See the ``Dynamic Frames'' tutorial
   and the Frames Required Reading, frames.req, for detailed discussions of
   this topic.
 
   The participants in this geometric relationship are an observer, a
   central body, and a satellite orbiting the central body. For this
   geometric case, ``orbital longitude'' is measured in the orbital plane
   of the satellite, in the positive sense about the satellite's angular
   velocity vector, with the zero longitude direction aligned with the
   orthogonal projection of the observer-central body vector onto the
   satellite's orbital plane. This definition is applicable, for example,
   when the Earth is the observer, Mars is the central body, and Phobos is
   the satellite.
 
   There is a different definition of orbital longitude for the case where
   the target is a planet, asteroid, or comet and the Earth is the
   observer: for this case, the Sun-Earth vector points in direction of
   zero longitude. We won't address this case, but it can be handled by a
   simple modification of the ORBITAL_LONG_FRAME we describe below.
 
   The first step is to specify a two-vector dynamic frame ORBIT_FRAME
   whose primary axis is aligned with the central body-satellite position
   vector; this is the frame's +X axis. Associate the secondary axis with
   the central body-satellite velocity vector; this is the frame's +Y axis.
   The +Z axis of ORBIT_FRAME is then aligned with the instantaneous
   angular velocity of the satellite's orbit.
 
   Next, specify a two-vector dynamic frame ORBITAL_LONG_FRAME whose
   primary axis is aligned with the +Z axis of ORBIT_FRAME; this is the +Z
   axis of ORBITAL_LONG_FRAME. Associate the secondary axis of
   ORBITAL_LONG_FRAME with the observer-central body position vector; this
   is the +X axis of ORBITAL_LONG_FRAME.
 
   Finally, call GFPOSC to search for times when the satellite's orbital
   longitude satisfies constraints of interest. For these searches, the
   observer is the central body, the target is the satellite, the reference
   frame is ORBITAL_LONG_FRAME, and the coordinate system and coordinate
   are, respectively, set to:
 
      'LATITUDINAL'
      'LONGITUDE'
 
   Aberration corrections should not be used for this application.
 
 
Approximate times of Cassini Saturn ring occultations
 
   An approximation of Saturn ring occultation ingress and egress times for
   the Cassini orbiter, as viewed by a given Deep Space Network (DSN)
   station, can be found using GFOCLT.
 
   For the purpose of this search, the ring boundaries can be approximated
   using two extremely flat spheroids, both of which are aligned, as is
   Saturn, with the IAU_SATURN reference frame. The large and small
   spheroids have equatorial radii equal to, respectively, the radii of the
   outer and inner ring boundaries. The polar radii can be set to 1 cm.
 
   Two searches using GFOCLT are required: the first search finds the time
   window when the orbiter is occulted by the larger spheroid. The result
   window from that search can be used as the confinement window for the
   second search, which finds the time window when the orbiter is occulted
   by the inner spheroid.
 
   Subtracting the result window of the second search from that of the
   first yields a window representing the time period of the ring
   occultations.
 
   To avoid having to create new SPICE kernels representing the
   trajectories, orientations, sizes, shapes, names, and ID codes of the
   spheroids, one simply creates them by temporarily changing the radii of
   Saturn.
 
   The radii of the spheroids can be set before each GFOCLT call by either:

       --   Calling PDPOOL to assign the desired radii to the kernel
            variable BODY699_RADII
 
   Normally the application should restore Saturn's original radii after
   the second search has been completed.
 
   For each of the searches, the DSN station is the observer, Saturn (with
   modified radii) is the ``front'' target body, and the Cassini orbiter is
   the ``back'' target body. The aberration correction should be set to
 
      'CN'
 
   The method described here will not work for edge-on or nearly edge-on
   viewing geometry: the ray-spheroid intercept computation fails to model
   the real occultation geometry in the first case and is too unstable to
   provide accurate results in the second.
 
   The assumption of straight-line radiation paths may also be unsuitable
   for very high-accuracy work.
 
 
Angular offset between instrument boresight and velocity
 
   Although the GF subsystem doesn't directly support searches involving
   coordinates of velocity vectors, one can use GFPOSC to find times when
   the angular separation of a spacecraft-mounted instrument's boresight
   vector and the instrument's (inertially referenced) velocity satisfies
   specified constraints.
 
   The first step is to create an SPK file for an artificial object whose
   position relative to the spacecraft's center of mass is parallel to the
   instrument's boresight direction. The SPICE utility PINPOINT can be used
   to create such an SPK file.
 
   Next, create a specification for a dynamic reference frame whose +Z axis
   is aligned with the spacecraft velocity vector. The view frame example
   in the Dynamic Frames tutorial demonstrates this.
 
   The colatitude of the vector from the spacecraft to the artificial
   object, expressed in the view frame, is the desired angular separation.
   An application program can call GFPOSC with the coordinate system and
   coordinate, respectively, set to
 
      'SPHERICAL'
      'COLATITUDE'
 
   to conduct the search.
 
 
Common GF Problems
===========================================================================
 
   Here we discuss some common problems that may arise when SPICE-based
   applications the use the GF subsystem.
 
 
A challenge
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   One noteworthy difference between debugging GF search problems and other
   types of computational problems is that GF searches don't assist the
   programmer by returning invalid geometric parameters; they just return
   time windows. While it can be obvious that a given distance or angle is
   incorrect, it's often much harder to determine, without much
   investigative work, that a given set of time intervals is incorrect.
 
   The conclusion to draw is that preventing problems by correctly setting
   up one's work is even more important for GF searches than for other
   types of computations.
 
 
Wrong SPICE kernels
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This is not a GF-specific issue, but it's one of the most common
   problems that occurs in SPICE applications. Using the correct SPICE
   kernel versions can make all the difference when trying to determine
   event times.
 
 
Insufficient kernel data
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   As with most work performed with SPICE, it's not uncommon for GF
   searches to terminate due to missing kernel data.
 
   Some of the common short error messages indicating missing data are:
 
      SPICE(NOTRANSLATION)
      SPICE(NOFRAME)
      SPICE(NOFRAMECONNECT)
      SPICE(FRAMEDATANOTFOUND)
      SPICE(SPKINSUFFDATA)
      SPICE(KERNELVARNOTFOUND)
 
   In many cases, a careful reading of the SPICE long error message will
   indicate the cause of the problem.
 
   Since it can be frustrating (or worse) to have a search run for a long
   time, and then have the search terminate due to missing data, we
   recommend that users verify that the required data are present before
   starting a search.
 
   The section titled ``Required SPICE kernels'' in the chapter ``GF
   Computational Recipes'' may be helpful.
 
   Often it's worthwhile to manually verify the coverage of the SPK and CK
   files intended to be used in a search; this can be done using the SPICE
   utilities BRIEF and CKBRIEF. See the user's guides brief.ug and
   ckbrief.ug for details.
 
   It can be very useful for an application to determine a time window over
   which required SPK and CK data are available. See the discussion and
   example code dealing with this task in the ROVER code example below.
 
 
Missed events
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Here are some simple reasons why a GF search might fail to find events
   that you know did occur:
 
       --   Kernel versions are wrong. For example, an out-of-date predict
            SPK or CK file can yield completely wrong viewing geometry.
 
       --   The step size is too long. See the discussion of search step
            size in the ``GF Concepts'' chapter.
 
            Note that proper understanding of the underlying geometry is
            crucial for correct step size selection. For example, incorrect
            assumptions about the period of a numeric quantity can lead to
            selecting a step size that's too large to capture all of the
            local extrema of the quantity.
 
       --   The confinement window is incorrect. If the event does occur,
            but not during the confinement window you're passing to the GF
            search routine, it won't be found.
 
 
Slow performance
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Slow performance may be due to an excessively small step size. See the
   step size discussion in the ``GF concepts'' chapter to get an idea of
   the step size requirements for your search.
 
   Slow performance is not necessarily indicative of an error.
 
   For a long search, it may not be evident just how slow the performance
   really is; one may only know that whatever fraction of the search has
   been completed has already taken a long time.
 
   Users of the Fortran and C SPICE Toolkits can use the mid-level search
   routines and enable progress reporting to determine a search's rate of
   progress.
 
   All SPICE users can shorten the confinement window until a search
   completes in a short time, then extrapolate the time required for the
   entire search.
 
 
Constraints not met on result window
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   New GF users may be surprised to learn that constraints are not
   necessarily met by times at the endpoints of, of even slightly inside,
   the intervals comprising the result window.
 
   See the discussion of time windows and window contraction in the ``GF
   Concepts'' chapter.
 
 
Result window intervals appear invalid
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   There are a number of reasons why a GF search can return a result window
   that appears ``just plain wrong.''
 
   Possible causes include:
 
       --   Invalid SPICE kernels---bad data or wrong versions.
 
       --   Step size is too long, causing events to be missed or multiple
            events to be seen as a single event.
 
       --   The search is attempting to extract results from noisy data.
            For example, it's difficult to find correct local extrema of
            the light-time corrected range rate (note: not yet implemented
            in SPICE) of the Moon relative to the Earth; near the times
            when the extrema occur, the variation of the quantity, as SPICE
            computes it, is on the same scale as the noise in the quantity.
 
       --   Models used by SPICE differ from those expected or those used
            in a search done using means other than SPICE. For example, in
            some cases, occultation times computed with spherical target
            models can differ by tens of minutes from those computed with
            ellipsoidal models.
 
 
GF Example Programs
===========================================================================
 
   The next several sections present example programs that illustrate use
   of GF routines to solve realistic geometry problems.
 
   All routines used in the examples are from SPICE.
 
   The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input, the
   compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine specific arithmetic
   implementation.
 
 
Program MEDLEY: Searches for Periapse, Occultation, Rise/Set
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Overview
 
   This example program demonstrates use of the GF subsystem to perform
   three relatively simple tasks:
 
       --   Find times of periapse of the Earth relative to the Sun over a
            specified decade.
 
       --   Find times when Titan is at least partially occulted by Saturn
            as seen from DSS-14, on a specified day. Occultations of
            duration less than ten minutes are ignored.
 
       --   Find times when Saturn is visible from DSS-14, over a specified
            5-day period. Saturn is considered to be visible when its
            elevation is above 6 degrees. These periods of visibility are
            sometimes called ``view periods.''
 
            The SPICE system doesn't support modeling of atmospheric
            effects such as refraction, so the target rise and set times
            found by this search are approximate.
 
   In the interest of brevity, both of the example code and of the
   discussion, the example program below combines the solutions of the
   above (unrelated) problems.
 
 
Aberration corrections
 
   For the Earth-Sun periapse computation, the goal is to find the local
   minima of distance given by the planetary ephemeris, as opposed to the
   apparent local minima, so no aberration corrections are used.
 
   For the occultation search, only light time corrections are needed.
   Normally computations involving apparent geometry of extended objects
   require correction of target positions for light time and stellar
   aberration, so the aberration correction flag
 
      'LT+S'
 
   would be used. However, stellar aberration corrections are unnecessary
   for occultation computations, since the respective stellar aberration
   corrections for the two targets are identical at the point of tangency
   of the figures of the targets. For this reason the GF occultation
   routine GFOCLT ignores the stellar aberration correction token
 
      '+S'
 
   if it's provided.
 
   For the view period search, the apparent position of Saturn is used, so
   both light time and stellar aberration corrections are applied.
 
 
SPICE kernels
 
   The meta-kernel used for this example is shown below.
 
 
      KPL/MK
 
         File: medley.tm
 
         Meta-kernel for example program MEDLEY.
 
         This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
         example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
         assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
         required by a user's own SPICE-based applications.
 
         In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
         kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
         current working directory.
 
         The names and contents of the kernels referenced
         by this meta-kernel are as follows:

Program CASCADE: Fast Search for Solar Eclipse
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Overview
 
   This example demonstrates a search for a solar eclipse as seen from a
   specified location on the Earth's surface, during the year 2008. The
   eclipse search speed is increased by a factor of over 100 by use of a
   preliminary search to determine a time window during which the apparent
   angular separation of the Sun and Moon is small enough so that an
   eclipse could occur.
 
   The price we pay to achieve this speed-up is that we must perform a
   little analysis of the observation geometry in order to decide how to
   perform the preliminary search.
 
   In this example, we use DSN station DSS-14 as the observer. We have an
   SPK file providing the geocentric station location in the ITRF93
   terrestrial reference frame, so we're able to treat the observer as a
   SPICE ephemeris object. For an arbitrary surface point, we could use the
   SPICE utility PINPOINT to create an SPK file containing that point's
   geocentric location.
 
   We consider a solar eclipse to be any (partial or full) occultation of
   the apparent Sun by the apparent Moon, so we perform the eclipse search
   using the GF occultation search routine GFOCLT. We're interested in
   detecting any occultation lasting a minute or more, so we use a step
   size of 60 seconds for this search. Since we're searching over a time
   span of one year, this search, if performed over the entire search
   interval, would require over 31 million occultation tests.
 
   To accelerate the search, we'll first narrow down the search period
   using a more rapid search---one for which we can use a step size of
   days, not seconds. We know an occultation can occur only when the
   angular separation of the Sun and Moon as seen from DSS-14 is small. If
   we can quickly find the time window over which the angular separation of
   the apparent figures of the Sun and Moon is less than a small upper
   bound, we can then gain speed by performing the slower occultation
   search only over this small window.
 
 
Specifying the angular separation search parameters
 
   In order to perform the angular separation search, we'll need to decide
   on the search step size and the upper bound of the angular separation.
   We'll also choose a convenient observation point relative to which the
   angular separation is defined.
 
   Recall that GF searches involving a scalar quantity, such as angular
   separation, have search step size requirements based on the separation
   in time of the local extrema of the quantity: except for longitude
   searches, the step must be smaller than the minimum time separation
   between the epochs of the extrema (minima and maxima) of the quantity,
   taken over the search interval. When these extrema are widely separated,
   a large step size can be used.
 
   So that we can pick a useful lower bound on the time separation of the
   extrema of angular separation, we want to define angular separation in
   such a way that this function is easy to analyze.
 
   There are two candidate observers we could use to define the angular
   separation of Sun and Moon: DSS-14 and the center of the Earth. If we
   use the center of the Earth, the relative angular velocity of the
   targets has only small relative variations in magnitude, except in the
   vicinity of its extrema, and we can be confident that we won't find any
   unexpected extrema of angular separation; however the angular separation
   we compute is slightly different than what we'd find using DSS-14 as the
   observer. If we use DSS-14 as the observer, we must consider whether the
   motion of the station relative to the center of the Earth introduces any
   additional extrema of angular separation beyond those occurring when the
   observer is the Earth's center.
 
   Since we can easily bound the angular separation error caused by using
   the Earth's center as the observer, we'll choose this observer, thus
   simplifying our analysis. The maximum angular separation error caused by
   this choice is roughly 1 degree; we'll conservatively pick 2 degrees as
   the error bound. If we pick a generous limit of 1 degree for angular
   separation of the figures of the Sun and Moon as seen from DSS-14,
   adding 2 degrees to this yields the 3 degree bound we'll use for the
   angular separation search.
 
   The angular separation of Sun and Moon as seen from the center of the
   Earth has a period of about four weeks. The local minima and maxima of
   the separation are separated by roughly two weeks. Since we don't want
   to perform a detailed analysis of the minimum time separation of the
   extrema, we simply pick a value that's guaranteed to be smaller than
   this minimum duration but large enough to be helpful: 5 days.
 
   If we were to perform this search repeatedly, it could be useful to
   analyze the problem further in order to compute a tighter angular
   separation bound and a smaller step size.
 
 
Aberration corrections
 
   Normally computations involving apparent geometry of extended objects
   require correcting target positions for light time and stellar
   aberration, so the aberration correction flag
 
      'LT+S'
 
   would be used. However, stellar aberration corrections are unnecessary
   for occultation computations, since the respective stellar aberration
   corrections for the two targets are identical at the point of tangency
   of the figures of the targets. For this reason the GF occultation
   routine GFOCLT ignores the stellar aberration correction token
 
      '+S'
 
   if it's provided. Only light time corrections are needed for the
   occultation search.

Results
 
   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input and
   the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
 
   The output from this program was as follows:
 
 
       Starting angular separation search.
       Done.
 
       Ratio of measure of short confinement window to original:
        0.00497163966
 
       Starting occultation search.
       Done.
 
       Occultations:
         2008 AUG 01 08:40:50.967887 TDB   2008 AUG 01 10:00:42.048379 TDB
 
 
   On this platform, the (wall clock) run time was about 0.95 seconds.
 
   When the angular separation search was removed (this can be done by
   commenting out the COPYD call in the source code), the run time was
   about 140 seconds.
 
 
Program ROVER: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter photographs MER-1
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Overview
 
   This program finds an approximate time window, during the month November
   2006, over which the MER-1 ("Opportunity") rover is visible within the
   Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) HIRISE field of view (FOV). Since
   HIRISE was used to photograph MER-1 during this time period, the timing
   results from this example program can be compared against actual data.
 
 
Determining SPK and CK coverage at run time
 
   This example involves multiple CK and SPK files. Because the coverage of
   the CK files has numerous gaps, and because we want the program to
   determine the times of coverage for all required data, the SPICE CK and
   SPK coverage routines CKCOV and SPKCOV are used. To ensure availability
   of data, certain modifications of the coverage windows found by these
   routines are required:
 
       --   Within CK files, CK coverage bounds are represented by encoded
            SCLK time. In order to conveniently work with these time
            bounds, they must be converted to Barycentric Dynamical Time
            (TDB). Each such conversion introduces a small amount of
            round-off error. These errors may prevent the TDB values from
            being converted back to encoded SCLK values within the CK
            coverage window.
 
            So the MRO spacecraft bus orientation coverage window is
            contracted slightly (that is, the left endpoint of each
            interval of the window is moved to the right, and the right
            endpoint of each interval is moved to the left) to eliminate
            any CK look-up failures that could result from these round-off
            errors.
 
       --   The intervals comprising the MER-1 SPK coverage window are
            contracted on the left to compensate for one-way light time
            between MER-1 and MRO. This ensures that times at the beginning
            of these intervals can be adjusted by one-way light time and
            still be within the actual coverage window for the MER-1 SPK
            files.
 
       --   The intervals comprising the MRO SPK coverage window are
            contracted by slightly more than one second on both sides to
            ensure data availability for stellar aberration computations.
            Even though we're performing searches involving constraints on
            observer-target position vectors, the GF subsystem uses the
            corresponding velocities to conduct these searches. The SPK
            subsystem's stellar aberration correction velocity computation
            requires observer acceleration with respect to the solar system
            barycenter. The acceleration at a given epoch ET is computed by
            discrete differentiation using samples taken at ET +/- one
            second.
 
            For the problem at hand, it happens that this contraction isn't
            needed because MRO SPK coverage is not the limiting factor
            determining the overall coverage window. The contraction is
            demonstrated in the interest of safety and broader
            applicability of the example.
 
   The intersection of the modified coverage windows yields a window over
   which all required data are available.
 
 
Speeding up the search
 
   Because of the minute angular extent of the MRO HIRISE field of view in
   the MRO downtrack direction, a simple search of the data availability
   window using the GF "is target in instrument FOV?" routine GFTFOV would
   be prohibitively slow. So the search is performed in three steps:
 
       1.   The data availability window is searched for times when the
            observer and target are separated by no more than 500 km. Since
            the nominal altitude of MRO above Mars' surface is about 300
            km, this limit allows for a substantial pointing offset
            relative to the nadir direction. The result of this search is
            the ``distance window'' DISTWN.
 
            The step size for this search can be large, since the epochs of
            the extrema of the observer-target distance are separated by
            almost an hour. For safety, a half-hour step is used.
 
       2.   Since the MRO spacecraft's downtrack direction is nominally
            aligned with the MRO_HIRISE_LOOK_DIRECTION frame's +X axis, the
            distance window is searched for times when the MER-1 rover
            crosses the MRO_HIRISE_LOOK_DIRECTION frame's Y-Z plane.
 
            This search produces a non-empty window of measure zero: the
            contents of the window are singleton intervals, some of which
            may lie in the time window during which MER-1 is in the MRO
            HIRISE FOV.
 
       3.   For each singleton interval in the result window of the Y-Z
            plane crossing search, we find the angular separation of the
            MRO-rover vector (which at the epochs of comparison lies in the
            camera's Y-Z plane) and the HIRISE +Z vector. We compare this
            angle to the angular half-width of the HIRISE nominal FOV; if
            the angle is smaller than the half-width, we consider the rover
            to be visible.
 
 
Pointing issues
 
   With nominal nadir pointing, the target moves in the downtrack direction
   with a period matching that of MRO's orbit, so extrema of the target's X
   coordinate in the HIRISE frame are almost an hour apart. However, if the
   spacecraft were to rotate rapidly, this effect could dominate that of
   the spacecraft's orbital motion, creating new extrema.
 
   Substantial deviation from the nominal nadir-pointed spacecraft
   orientation could also prevent the HIRISE FOV from ``seeing'' the
   target.
 
   Based on prior knowledge, we expect this search to find two solutions.
   The results of the search will show that the solutions are the ones we
   want: we have near-nadir pointing at the visibility epochs in each case.
 
   In a more realistic setting, we would need to ensure that no valid
   solutions were missed. This could be done by reducing the step size for
   the MRO_HIRISE_LOOK_DIRECTION frame's Y-Z plane crossing search.
   Alternatively, the spacecraft pointing could be analyzed for the time
   window over which the Y-Z plane crossing search is performed.
 
 
Aberration corrections
 
   The searches described above involve apparent target geometry, so in all
   but the distance search, which need not produce highly accurate results,
   light time and stellar aberration corrections are used. The flag
   indicating these aberration corrections is
 
      'LT+S'
