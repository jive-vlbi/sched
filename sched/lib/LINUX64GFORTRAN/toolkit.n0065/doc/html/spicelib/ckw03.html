     HANDLE     is the handle of the CK file to which the segment will
                be written. The file must have been opened with write
                access.

     BEGTIM,    are the beginning and ending encoded SCLK times for
     ENDTIM     which the segment provides pointing information.
                BEGTIM must be less than or equal to the SCLK time
                associated with the first pointing instance in the
                segment, and ENDTIM must be greater than or equal to
                the time associated with the last pointing instance
                in the segment.

     INST       is the NAIF integer ID code for the instrument that
                this segment will contain pointing information for.

     REF        is a character string which specifies the inertial
                reference frame of the segment.

                The rotation matrices represented by the quaternions
                that are to be written to the segment transform the
                components of vectors from the inertial reference frame
                specified by REF to components in the instrument fixed
                frame. Also, the components of the angular velocity
                vectors to be written to the segment should be given
                with respect to REF.

                REF should be the name of one of the frames supported
                by the SPICELIB routine <a href="framex.html">FRAMEX</a>.

     AVFLAG     is a logical flag which indicates whether or not the
                segment will contain angular velocity.

     SEGID      is the segment identifier. A CK segment identifier may
                contain up to 40 printable characters and spaces.

     NREC       is the number of pointing instances in the segment.

     SCLKDP     are the encoded spacecraft clock times associated with
                each pointing instance. These times must be strictly
                increasing.

     QUATS      is an array of SPICE-style quaternions representing
                a sequence of C-matrices. See the discussion of
                quaternion styles in Particulars below.

                The C-matrix represented by the Ith quaternion in
                QUATS is a rotation matrix that transforms the
                components of a vector expressed in the inertial
                frame specified by REF to components expressed in
                the instrument fixed frame at the time SCLKDP(I).

                Thus, if a vector V has components x, y, z in the
                inertial frame, then V has components x', y', z' in
                the instrument fixed frame where:

                     [ x' ]     [          ] [ x ]
                     | y' |  =  |   CMAT   | | y |
                     [ z' ]     [          ] [ z ]

     AVVS       are the angular velocity vectors ( optional ).

                The Ith vector in AVVS gives the angular velocity of
                the instrument fixed frame at time SCLKDP(I). The
                components of the angular velocity vectors should
                be given with respect to the inertial reference frame
                specified by REF.

                The direction of an angular velocity vector gives
                the right-handed axis about which the instrument fixed
                reference frame is rotating. The magnitude of the
                vector is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity
                of the rotation, in radians per second.

                If AVFLAG is FALSE then this array is ignored by the
                routine; however it still must be supplied as part of
                the calling sequence.

     NINTS      is the number of intervals that the pointing instances
                are partitioned into.

     STARTS     are the start times of each of the interpolation
                intervals. These times must be strictly increasing
                and must coincide with times for which the segment
                contains pointing.

     1)  If HANDLE is not the handle of a C-kernel opened for writing
         the error will be diagnosed by routines called by this
         routine.

     2)  If SEGID is more than 40 characters long, the error
         SPICE(SEGIDTOOLONG) is signaled.

     3)  If SEGID contains any non-printable characters, the error
         SPICE(NONPRINTABLECHARS) is signaled.

     4)  If the first encoded SCLK time is negative then the error
         SPICE(INVALIDSCLKTIME) is signaled. If any subsequent times
         are negative the error will be detected in exception (5).

     5)  If the encoded SCLK times are not strictly increasing,
         the error SPICE(TIMESOUTOFORDER) is signaled.

     6)  If BEGTIM is greater than SCLKDP(1) or ENDTIM is less than
         SCLKDP(NREC), the error SPICE(INVALIDDESCRTIME) is
         signaled.

     7)  If the name of the reference frame is not one of those
         supported by the routine <a href="framex.html">FRAMEX</a>, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDREFFRAME) is signaled.

     8)  If NREC, the number of pointing records, is less than or
         equal to 0, the error SPICE(INVALIDNUMREC) is signaled.

     9)  If NINTS, the number of interpolation intervals, is less than
         or equal to 0, the error SPICE(INVALIDNUMINT) is signaled.

    10)  If the encoded SCLK interval start times are not strictly
         increasing, the error SPICE(TIMESOUTOFORDER) is signaled.

    11)  If an interval start time does not coincide with a time for
         which there is an actual pointing instance in the segment,
         then the error SPICE(INVALIDSTARTTIME) is signaled.

    12)  This routine assumes that the rotation between adjacent
         quaternions that are stored in the same interval has a
         rotation angle of THETA radians, where

            0  &lt;  THETA  &lt;  pi.
               _

         The routines that evaluate the data in the segment produced
         by this routine cannot distinguish between rotations of THETA
         radians, where THETA is in the interval [0, pi), and
         rotations of

            THETA   +   2 * k * pi

         radians, where k is any integer.  These `large' rotations will
         yield invalid results when interpolated.  You must ensure that
         the data stored in the segment will not be subject to this
         sort of ambiguity.

    13)  If any quaternion has magnitude zero, the error
         SPICE(ZEROQUATERNION) is signaled.

    14)  If the start time of the first interval and the time of the
         first pointing instance are not the same, the error
         SPICE(TIMESDONTMATCH) is signaled.

     Quaternion Styles
     -----------------

     There are different &quot;styles&quot; of quaternions used in 
     science and engineering applications. Quaternion styles
     are characterized by 

        - The order of quaternion elements

        - The quaternion multiplication formula

        - The convention for associating quaternions
          with rotation matrices

     Two of the commonly used styles are

        - &quot;SPICE&quot;

           &gt; Invented by Sir William Rowan Hamilton
           &gt; Frequently used in mathematics and physics textbooks

        - &quot;Engineering&quot;

           &gt; Widely used in aerospace engineering applications


     SPICELIB subroutine interfaces ALWAYS use SPICE quaternions.
     Quaternions of any other style must be converted to SPICE
     quaternions before they are passed to SPICELIB routines.
     

     Relationship between SPICE and Engineering Quaternions
     ------------------------------------------------------

     Let M be a rotation matrix such that for any vector V, 

        M*V

     is the result of rotating V by theta radians in the 
     counterclockwise direction about unit rotation axis vector A.
     Then the SPICE quaternions representing M are

        (+/-) (  cos(theta/2), 
                 sin(theta/2) A(1),  
                 sin(theta/2) A(2),  
                 sin(theta/2) A(3)  ) 

     while the engineering quaternions representing M are 

        (+/-) ( -sin(theta/2) A(1),  
                -sin(theta/2) A(2),  
                -sin(theta/2) A(3),
                 cos(theta/2)       )

     For both styles of quaternions, if a quaternion q represents
     a rotation matrix M, then -q represents M as well.

     Given an engineering quaternion

        QENG   = ( q0,  q1,  q2,  q3 )

     the equivalent SPICE quaternion is

        QSPICE = ( q3, -q0, -q1, -q2 )


     Associating SPICE Quaternions with Rotation Matrices
     ----------------------------------------------------

     Let FROM and TO be two right-handed reference frames, for
     example, an inertial frame and a spacecraft-fixed frame. Let the
     symbols

        V    ,   V
         FROM     TO

     denote, respectively, an arbitrary vector expressed relative to
     the FROM and TO frames. Let M denote the transformation matrix
     that transforms vectors from frame FROM to frame TO; then

        V   =  M * V
         TO         FROM

     where the expression on the right hand side represents left
     multiplication of the vector by the matrix.

     Then if the unit-length SPICE quaternion q represents M, where

        q = (q0, q1, q2, q3)

     the elements of M are derived from the elements of q as follows:

          +-                                                         -+
          |           2    2                                          |
          | 1 - 2*( q2 + q3 )   2*(q1*q2 - q0*q3)   2*(q1*q3 + q0*q2) |
          |                                                           |
          |                                                           |
          |                               2    2                      |
      M = | 2*(q1*q2 + q0*q3)   1 - 2*( q1 + q3 )   2*(q2*q3 - q0*q1) |
          |                                                           |
          |                                                           |
          |                                                   2    2  |
          | 2*(q1*q3 - q0*q2)   2*(q2*q3 + q0*q1)   1 - 2*( q1 + q2 ) |
          |                                                           |
          +-                                                         -+

     Note that substituting the elements of -q for those of q in the
     right hand side leaves each element of M unchanged; this shows
     that if a quaternion q represents a matrix M, then so does the
     quaternion -q.

     To map the rotation matrix M to a unit quaternion, we start by
     decomposing the rotation matrix as a sum of symmetric
     and skew-symmetric parts:

                                        2
        M = [ I  +  (1-cos(theta)) OMEGA  ] + [ sin(theta) OMEGA ]

                     symmetric                   skew-symmetric


     OMEGA is a skew-symmetric matrix of the form

                   +-             -+
                   |  0   -n3   n2 |
                   |               |
         OMEGA  =  |  n3   0   -n1 |
                   |               |
                   | -n2   n1   0  |
                   +-             -+

     The vector N of matrix entries (n1, n2, n3) is the rotation axis
     of M and theta is M's rotation angle.  Note that N and theta
     are not unique.

     Let

        C = cos(theta/2)
        S = sin(theta/2)

     Then the unit quaternions Q corresponding to M are

        Q = +/- ( C, S*n1, S*n2, S*n3 )

     The mappings between quaternions and the corresponding rotations
     are carried out by the SPICELIB routines

        <a href="q2m.html">Q2M</a> {quaternion to matrix}
        <a href="m2q.html">M2Q</a> {matrix to quaternion}

     <a href="m2q.html">M2Q</a> always returns a quaternion with scalar part greater than
     or equal to zero.


     SPICE Quaternion Multiplication Formula
     ---------------------------------------

     Given a SPICE quaternion 

        Q = ( q0, q1, q2, q3 )

     corresponding to rotation axis A and angle theta as above, we can
     represent Q using &quot;scalar + vector&quot; notation as follows:

        s =   q0           = cos(theta/2)

        v = ( q1, q2, q3 ) = sin(theta/2) * A

        Q = s + v

     Let Q1 and Q2 be SPICE quaternions with respective scalar
     and vector parts s1, s2 and v1, v2:
 
        Q1 = s1 + v1
        Q2 = s2 + v2

     We represent the dot product of v1 and v2 by

        &lt;v1, v2&gt;

     and the cross product of v1 and v2 by

        v1 x v2

     Then the SPICE quaternion product is

        Q1*Q2 = s1*s2 - &lt;v1,v2&gt;  + s1*v2 + s2*v1 + (v1 x v2)       

     If Q1 and Q2 represent the rotation matrices M1 and M2 
     respectively, then the quaternion product

        Q1*Q2

     represents the matrix product

        M1*M2

  C     This example code fragment writes a type 3 C-kernel segment

  C     Assume arrays of quaternions, angular velocities, and the
  C     associated SCLK times are produced elsewhere.  The software
  C     that calls <b>CKW03</b> must then decide how to partition these
  C     pointing instances into intervals over which linear
  C     interpolation between adjacent points is valid.

  C        1) SCLK limits of the segment.

     1) The creator of the segment is given the responsibility for
        determining whether it is reasonable to interpolate between
        two given pointing values.

    2)  This routine assumes that the rotation between adjacent
        quaternions that are stored in the same interval has a
        rotation angle of THETA radians, where

            0  &lt;  THETA  &lt;  pi.
               _

        The routines that evaluate the data in the segment produced
        by this routine cannot distinguish between rotations of THETA
        radians, where THETA is in the interval [0, pi), and
        rotations of

            THETA   +   2 * k * pi

        radians, where k is any integer.  These `large' rotations will
        yield invalid results when interpolated.  You must ensure that
        the data stored in the segment will not be subject to this
        sort of ambiguity.

     3) All pointing instances in the segment must belong to one and
        only one of the intervals.

    SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 01-JUN-2010 (NJB)

        The check for non-unit quaternions has been replaced
        with a check for zero-length quaternions.

    SPICELIB Version 2.3.0, 26-FEB-2008 (NJB)

        Updated header; added information about SPICE 
        quaternion conventions.

        Minor typo in a long error message was corrected.

    SPICELIB Version 2.2.0, 26-SEP-2005 (BVS)

        Added check to ensure that the start time of the first 
        interval is the same as the time of the first pointing 
        instance.

    SPICELIB Version 2.1.0, 22-FEB-1999 (WLT)

        Added check to make sure that all quaternions are unit
        length to single precision.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 28-DEC-1993 (WLT)

        The routine was upgraded to support non-inertial reference
        frames.

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.1, 05-SEP-1993 (KRG)

        Removed all references to a specific method of opening the CK
        file in the $ Brief_I/O, $ Detailed_Input, $ Exceptions,
        $ Files, and $ Examples sections of the header. It is assumed
        that a person using this routine has some knowledge of the DAF
        system and the methods for obtaining file handles.
