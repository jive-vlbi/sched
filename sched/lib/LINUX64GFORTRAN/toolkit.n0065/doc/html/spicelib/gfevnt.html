<h4><a name="Detailed_Input">Detailed_Input</a></h4>
<PRE>
     UDSTEP     the name of the user specified routine that computes
                a time step in an attempt to find a transition of the
                state of the specified coordinate. In the context
                of this routine's algorithm, a &quot;state transition&quot;
                occurs where the geometric state changes from being
                in the desired geometric condition event to not,
                or vice versa.

                This routine relies on UDSTEP returning step sizes
                small enough so that state transitions within the
                confinement window are not overlooked.  There must
                never be two roots A and B separated by less than
                STEP, where STEP is the minimum step size returned by
                UDSTEP for any value of ET in the interval [A, B].

                The calling sequence for UDSTEP is:

                   CALL UDSTEP ( ET, STEP )

                where:

                   ET      is the input start time from which the
                           algorithm is to search forward for a state
                           transition. ET is expressed as seconds past
                           J2000 TDB.

                   STEP    is the output step size.  STEP indicates
                           how far to advance ET so that ET and
                           ET+STEP may bracket a state transition and
                           definitely do not bracket more than one
                           state transition. Units are TDB seconds.

                If a constant step size is desired, the routine

                   <a href="gfstep.html">GFSTEP</a>

                may be used. This is the default option. If using
                <a href="gfstep.html">GFSTEP</a>, the step size must be set by calling

                   <a href="gfsstp.html">GFSSTP</a>(STEP)

                prior to calling this routine.

     UDREFN     the name of the user specified routine that computes
                a refinement in the times that bracket a transition
                point. In other words, once a pair of times have been
                detected such that the system is in different states at
                each of the two times, UDREFN selects an intermediate
                time which should be closer to the transition state
                than one of the two known times.

                The calling sequence for UDREFN is:

                   CALL UDREFN ( T1, T2, S1, S2, T )

                where the inputs are:

                   T1    is a time when the system is in state S1. T1
                         is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

                   T2    is a time when the system is in state S2. T2
                         is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB. T2
                         is assumed to be larger than T1.

                   S1    is the state of the system at time T1.
                         S1 is a LOGICAL value.

                   S2    is the state of the system at time T2.
                         S2 is a LOGICAL value.

                UDREFN may use or ignore the S1 and S2 values.

                The output is:

                   T    is next time to check for a state transition.
                        T has value between T1 and T2. T is
                        expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

                If a simple bisection method is desired, the routine

                   <a href="gfrefn.html">GFREFN</a>

                may be used. This is the default option.

     GQUANT     is a string containing the name of a geometric
                quantity.  The times when this quantity satisfies
                a condition specified by the arguments OP
                and ADJUST (described below) are to be found.

                Each quantity is specified by the quantity name
                given in argument GQUANT, and by a set of parameters
                specified by the arguments

                   QNPARS
                   QPNAMS
                   QCPARS
                   QDPARS
                   QIPARS
                   QLPARS

                For each quantity listed here, we also show how to
                set up the input arguments to define the quantity.
                See the detailed discussion of these arguments
                below for further information.

                GQUANT may be any of the strings:

                   'ANGULAR SEPARATION'
                   'COORDINATE'
                   'DISTANCE'
                   'ILLUMINATION ANGLE'
                   'PHASE ANGLE'
                   'RANGE RATE'

                GQUANT strings are case insensitive.  Values,
                meanings, and associated parameters are discussed
                below.

                The aberration correction parameter indicates the
                aberration corrections to be applied to the state of
                the target body to account for one-way light time and
                stellar aberration. If relevant, it applies to the
                rotation of the target body as well.

                Supported aberration correction options for
                observation (case where radiation is received by
                observer at ET) are:

                  'NONE'          No correction.
                  'LT'            Light time only.
                  'LT+S'          Light time and stellar aberration.
                  'CN'            Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                  'CN+S'          CN light time and stellar aberration.

                Supported aberration correction options for
                transmission (case where radiation is emitted from
                observer at ET) are:

                  'XLT'           Light time only.
                  'XLT+S'         Light time and stellar aberration.
                  'XCN'           Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                  'XCN+S'         CN light time and stellar aberration.

                For detailed information, see the geometry finder
                required reading, gf.req.

                Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
                in aberration correction parameter strings.


             ANGULAR SEPARATION

                   is the apparent angular separation of two target
                   bodies as seen from an observing body.

                      Quantity Parameters:

                      QNPARS    = 8
                      QPNAMS(1) = 'TARGET1'
                      QPNAMS(2) = 'FRAME1'
                      QPNAMS(3) = 'SHAPE1'
                      QPNAMS(4) = 'TARGET2'
                      QPNAMS(5) = 'FRAME2'
                      QPNAMS(6) = 'SHAPE2'
                      QPNAMS(7) = 'OBSERVER'
                      QPNAMS(8) = 'ABCORR'

                      QCPARS(1) = &lt;name of first target&gt;
                      QCPARS(2) = &lt;name of body-fixed frame
                                            of first target&gt;
                      QCPARS(3) = &lt;shape of first target&gt;
                      QCPARS(4) = &lt;name of second target&gt;
                      QCPARS(5) = &lt;name of body-fixed frame
                                            of second target&gt;
                      QCPARS(6) = &lt;shape of second target&gt;
                      QCPARS(7) = &lt;name of observer&gt;
                      QCPARS(8) = &lt;aberration correction&gt;

                   The target shape model specifiers may be set to
                   either of the values

                      'POINT'
                      'SPHERE'

                   The shape models for the two bodies need not match.

                   Spherical models have radii equal to the longest
                   equatorial radius of the PCK-based tri-axial
                   ellipsoids used to model the respective bodies.
                   When both target bodies are modeled as spheres, the
                   angular separation between the bodies is the angle
                   between the closest points on the limbs of the
                   spheres, as viewed from the vantage point of the
                   observer. If the limbs overlap, the angular
                   separation is negative.

                   (In this case, the angular separation is the angle
                   between the centers of the spheres minus the sum of
                   the apparent angular radii of the spheres.)


             COORDINATE

                   is a coordinate of a specified vector in a specified
                   reference frame and coordinate system.  For example,
                   a coordinate can be the Z component of the earth-sun
                   vector in the J2000 reference frame, or the latitude
                   of the nearest point on Mars to an orbiting
                   spacecraft, expressed relative to the IAU_MARS
                   reference frame.

                   The method by which the vector is defined is
                   indicated by the

                      'VECTOR DEFINITION'

                   parameter.  Allowed values and meanings of this
                   parameter are:

                      'POSITION'

                         The vector is defined by the
                         position of a target relative to
                         an observer.

                      'SUB-OBSERVER POINT'

                         The vector is the sub-observer point
                         on a specified target body.

                      'SURFACE INTERCEPT POINT'

                         The vector is defined as the
                         intercept point of a vector from the
                         observer to the target body.

                   Some vector definitions such as the sub-observer
                   point may be specified by a variety of methods, so
                   a parameter is provided to select the computation
                   method. The computation method parameter name is

                      'METHOD'

                   If the vector definition is

                      'POSITION'

                   the METHOD parameter must be set to blank:

                      ' '

                   If the vector definition is

                      'SUB-OBSERVER POINT'

                   the METHOD parameter must be set to either:

                      'Near point: ellipsoid'
                      'Intercept: ellipsoid'

                   If the vector definition is

                      'SURFACE INTERCEPT POINT'

                   the METHOD parameter must be set to:

                      'Ellipsoid'

                         The intercept computation uses
                         a triaxial ellipsoid to model
                         the surface of the target body.
                         The ellipsoid's radii must be
                         available in the kernel pool.

                                      'ALTITUDE'

                   When geodetic coordinates are selected, the radii
                   used are those of the central body associated with
                   the reference frame. For example, if IAU_MARS is the
                   reference frame, then geodetic coordinates are
                   calculated using the radii of Mars taken from a
                   SPICE planetary constants kernel. One cannot ask for
                   geodetic coordinates for a frame which doesn't have
                   an extended body as its center.

                   Reference frame names must be recognized by the
                   SPICE frame subsystem.

     QNPARS     is the count of quantity parameter definition
                parameters.  These parameters supply the quantity-
                specific information needed to fully define the
                quantity used in the search performed by this routine.

     QPNAMS     is an array of names of quantity definition parameters.
                The names occupy elements 1:QNPARS of this array.
                The value associated with the Ith element of QPNAMS
                is located in element I of the parameter value argument
                having data type appropriate for the parameter:

                   Data Type                      Argument
                   ---------                      --------
                   Character strings              QCPARS
                   Double precision numbers       QDPARS
                   Integers                       QIPARS
                   Logicals                       QLPARS

                The order in which the parameter names are listed
                is unimportant, as long as the corresponding
                parameter values are listed in the same order.

                The names in QPNAMS are case-insensitive.

                See the description of the input argument GQUANT
                for a discussion of the parameter names and values
                associated with a given quantity.

     QCPARS,
     QDPARS,
     QIPARS,
     QLPARS     are, respectively, parameter value arrays of types

                   CHARACTER*(*)       QCPARS
                   DOUBLE PRECISION    QDPARS
                   INTEGER             QIPARS
                   LOGICAL             QLPARS

                The value associated with the Ith name in the array
                QPNAMS resides in the Ith element of whichever of
                these arrays has the appropriate data type.

                All of these arrays should be declared with dimension
                at least QNPARS.

                The names in the array QCPARS are case-insensitive.

                Note that there is no required order for QPNAMS/Q*PARS
                pairs.

                See the description of the input argument GQUANT
                for a discussion of the parameter names and values
                associated with a given quantity.

     OP         is a scalar string comparison operator indicating
                the numeric constraint of interest. Values are:

                   '&gt;'   value of geometric quantity greater than some
                         reference (REFVAL).

                   '='   value of geometric quantity equal to some
                         reference (REFVAL).

                   '&lt;'   value of geometric quantity less than some
                         reference (REFVAL).

                   'ABSMAX'  The geometric quantity is at an absolute
                             maximum.

                   'ABSMIN'  The geometric quantity is at an absolute
                              minimum.

                   'LOCMAX'  The geometric quantity is at a local
                             maximum.

                   'LOCMIN'  The geometric quantity is at a local
                             minimum.

                The caller may indicate that the region of interest
                is the set of time intervals where the quantity is
                within a specified distance of an absolute extremum.
                The argument ADJUST (described below) is used to
                specified this distance.

                Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
                interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
                window:  a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
                point of the confinement window.

                Case is not significant in the string OP.

     REFVAL     is the reference value used to define an equality or
                inequality to be satisfied by the geometric quantity.
                The units of REFVAL are radians, radians/sec, km, or
                km/sec as appropriate.

     TOL        is a tolerance value used to determine convergence of
                root-finding operations.  TOL is measured in ephemeris

     ADJUST     the amount by which the quantity is allowed to vary
                from an absolute extremum.

                If the search is for an absolute minimum is performed,
                the resulting window contains time intervals when the
                geometric quantity 'gquant' has values between
                ABSMIN and ABSMIN + 'adjust'.

                If the search is for an absolute maximum, the
                corresponding range is  between ABSMAX - 'adjust' and
                ABSMAX.

                ADJUST is not used for searches for local extrema,
                equality or inequality conditions and must have value
                zero for such searches. ADJUST must not be
                negative.

     CNFINE     is a SPICE window that confines the time period over
                which the specified search is conducted. CNFINE may
                consist of a single interval or a collection of
                intervals.

                In some cases the confinement window can be used to
                greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
                for the desired solution. See the Particulars section
                below for further discussion.

                See the Examples section below for a code example
                that shows how to create a confinement window.

     RPT        is a logical variable which controls whether the
                progress reporter is enabled. When RPT is TRUE,
                progress reporting is enabled and the routines
                UDREPI, UDREPU, and UDREPF (see descriptions below)
                are used to report progress.

     UDREPI     the name of the user specified routine that initializes
                a progress report.  When progress reporting is
                enabled, UDREPI is called at the start
                of a search.  The calling sequence of UDREPI is

                   CHARACTER*(*)       SRCSUF

                where

                   CNFINE

                is a confinement window specifying the time period
                over which a search is conducted, and

                   SRCPRE
                   SRCSUF

                are prefix and suffix strings used in the progress
                report: these strings are intended to bracket a
                representation of the fraction of work done. For
                example, when the progress reporting functions
                are used, if SRCPRE and SRCSUF are, respectively,

                   'Occultation/transit search'
                   'done.'

                the progress report display at the end of
                the search will be:

                   Occultation/transit search 100.00% done.

                If the user doesn't wish to provide a custom set of

     UDREPU     the name of the user specified routine that updates
                the progress report for a search. The calling sequence
                of UDREPU is

                   DOUBLE PRECISION      ET
                   DOUBLE PRECISION      IVBEG
                   DOUBLE PRECISION      IVEND

                where ET is an epoch belonging to the confinement
                window, IVBEG and IVEND are the start and stop times,
                respectively of the current confinement window
                interval.  The ratio of the measure of the portion
                of CNFINE that precedes ET to the measure of CNFINE
                would be a logical candidate for the searches
                completion percentage; however the method of
                measurement is up to the user.

                If the user doesn't wish to provide a custom set of
                progress reporting functions, the routine

                   <a href="gfrepu.html">GFREPU</a>

     UDREPF     the name of the user specified routine that finalizes
                a progress report.  UDREPF has no arguments.

                If the user doesn't wish to provide a custom set of
                progress reporting functions, the routine

                   <a href="gfrepf.html">GFREPF</a>

                may be used.

     MW         is a parameter specifying the length of the SPICE
                windows in the workspace array WORK (see description
                below) used by this routine.

                MW should be set to a number at least twice as large
                as the maximum number of intervals required by any
                workspace window. In many cases, it's not necessary to
                compute an accurate estimate of how many intervals are
                needed; rather, the user can pick a size considerably
                larger than what's really required.

                However, since excessively large arrays can prevent
                applications from compiling, linking, or running
                properly, sometimes MW must be set according to
                the actual workspace requirement. A rule of thumb
                for the number of intervals NINTVLS needed is

                  NINTVLS  =  2*N  +  ( M / STEP )

               where

                   N     is the number of intervals in the confinement
                         window

                   M     is the measure of the confinement window, in
                         units of seconds

                   STEP  is the search step size in seconds

               MW should then be set to

                  2 * NINTVLS

     NW         is a parameter specifying the number of SPICE windows
                in the workspace array WORK (see description below)
                used by this routine.  (The reason this dimension is
                an input argument is that this allows run-time
                error checking to be performed.)

     WORK       is an array used to store workspace windows. This
                array should be declared by the caller as shown:

                    DOUBLE PRECISION     WORK ( LBCELL : MW,  NW )

                WORK need not be initialized by the caller.

     BAIL       is a logical indicating whether or not interrupt
                signaling is enabled. When `bail' is set to TRUE,
                the input function UDBAIL (see description below)
                is used to determine whether an interrupt has been
                issued.

     UDBAIL     the name of the user specified routine that
                indicates whether an interrupt signal has been
                issued (for example, from the keyboard).  UDBAIL
                has no arguments and returns a LOGICAL value.
                The return value is .TRUE. if an interrupt has
                been issued; otherwise the value is .FALSE.

                <b>GFEVNT</b> uses UDBAIL only when BAIL (see above) is set
                to .TRUE., indicating that interrupt handling is
                enabled. When interrupt handling is enabled, <b>GFEVNT</b>
                and routines in its call tree will call UDBAIL to
                determine whether to terminate processing and return
                immediately.

                If interrupt handing is not enabled, a logical
                function must still be passed as an input argument.

         the QCPARS(1) and QCPARS(2) objects must be distinct.

     2)  If any of the bodies involved do not have NAIF ID codes, the

     7)  If the sizes of the workspace windows are too small,

         A non-zero value for ADJUST when OP has any value other than

    10)  The user must take care when searching for an extremum

         Problems are most common when using the COORDINATE value of
         GQUANT with LONGITUDE or RIGHT ASCENSION values for the
         coordinate name. Since these quantities are cyclical, rather
         than monotonically increasing or decreasing, an extremum may
         be hard to interpret. In particular, if an extremum is found
         near the cycle boundary (- <a href="pi.html">PI</a> for longitude, 2 <a href="pi.html">PI</a> for
         RIGHT ASCENSION) it may not be numerically reasonable. For
         example, the search for times when a longitude coordinate is
         at its absolute maximum may result in a time when the
         longitude value is - <a href="pi.html">PI</a>, due to roundoff error.

     Appropriate SPK and PCK kernels must be loaded by the

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: ephemeris data for target, source and observer that
          describes the ephemeris of these objects for the period
          defined by the confinement window, CNFINE must be
          loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of
          target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
          must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.
          Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one
          or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - PCK data: bodies are assumed to be spherical and must have a
          radius loaded from the kernel pool. Typically this is done by
          loading a text PCK file via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>. If the bodies are
          triaxial, the largest radius is chosen as that of the
          equivalent spherical body.

     This routine provides the SPICE GF subsystem's general interface
     to determines time intervals when the value of some
     geometric quantity related to one or more objects and an observer
     satisfies a user specified constraint. It puts these times in a
     result window called RESULT. It does this by first finding
     windows when the quantity of interest is either monotonically
     increasing or decreasing. These windows are then manipulated to
     give the final result.

     Applications that require do not require support for progress
     reporting, interrupt handling, non-default step or refinement
     functions, or non-default convergence tolerance normally should
     call a high level geometry quantity routine rather than
     this routine.

     The Search Process
     ==================

     Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
     routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
     periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified
     geometric quantity function is monotone increasing and monotone
     decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE
     window. Having found these windows, all of the quantity
     function's local extrema within the confinement window are known.
     Absolute extrema then can be found very easily.

     Within any interval of these &quot;monotone&quot; windows, there will be at
     most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
     of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
     the union of

        - the set of points where an equality constraint is met
        - the boundary points of the confinement window

     the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
     found easily once the monotone windows have been found.


     Step Size
     =========

     The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step
     search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
     searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
     determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
     change of quantity function will be sampled. Starting at
     the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be taken at each
     step. If a change of sign is found, a root has been bracketed; at
     that point, the time at which the time derivative of the quantity
     function is zero can be found by a refinement process, for
     example, using a binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the quantity function is monotone:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
     intervals (within the confinement window).

     The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
     of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
     the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
     shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
     of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
     result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
     monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
     state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
     specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
     miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
     shortest solution interval.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and
     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
     time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance,&quot; passed to this routine as 'tol'.

     The GF subsystem defines a parameter, CNVTOL (from gf.inc), as a
     default tolerance. This represents a &quot;tight&quot; tolerance value
     so that the tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the
     accuracy of solutions found by this routine. In general the
     accuracy of input data will be the limiting factor.

     Making the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to
     be useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater affect
     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed.

        Edit to comments to correct search description.

        Edit to Index_Entries.

        Added geometric quantities:

           Phase Angle
           Illumination Angle

        Code edits to implement use of ZZGFRELX in event calculations:

           Range rate
           Separation angle
           Distance
           Coordinate

        The code changes for ZZGFRELX use should not affect the
        numerical results of GF computations.
