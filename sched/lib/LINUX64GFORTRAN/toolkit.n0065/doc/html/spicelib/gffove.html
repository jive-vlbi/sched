     INST       indicates the name of an instrument, such as a
                spacecraft-mounted framing camera, the field of view
                (FOV) of which is to be used for a target intersection
                search: times when the specified target intersects the
                region of space corresponding to the FOV are sought.

                INST must have a corresponding NAIF ID and a frame
                defined, as is normally done in a frame kernel. It
                must also have an associated reference frame and a FOV
                shape, boresight and boundary vertices (or reference
                vector and reference angles) defined, as is usually
                done in an instrument kernel.

                See the header of the SPICELIB routine <a href="getfov.html">GETFOV</a> for a
                description of the required parameters associated with
                an instrument.


     TSHAPE     is a string indicating the geometric model used to
                represent the location and shape of the target body.
                The target body may be represented by either an
                ephemeris object or a ray emanating from the observer.

                The supported values of TSHAPE are:

                   'ELLIPSOID'     The target is an ephemeris object.

                                   The target's shape is represented
                                   using triaxial ellipsoid model,
                                   with radius values provided via the
                                   kernel pool. A kernel variable
                                   having a name of the form

                                      'BODYnnn_RADII' 

                                   where nnn represents the NAIF
                                   integer code associated with the
                                   body, must be present in the kernel
                                   pool. This variable must be
                                   associated with three numeric
                                   values giving the lengths of the
                                   ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.

                   'POINT'         The target is an ephemeris object.
                                   The body is treated as a single
                                   point.

                   'RAY'           The target is NOT an ephemeris
                                   object. Instead, the target is
                                   represented by the ray emanating
                                   from the observer's location and
                                   having direction vector RAYDIR. The
                                   target is considered to be visible
                                   if and only if the ray is contained
                                   within the space bounded by the
                                   instrument FOV.

                Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string TSHAPE.


     RAYDIR     is the direction vector associated with a ray 
                representing the target. RAYDIR is used if and only
                if TSHAPE (see description above) indicates the
                target is modeled as a ray.


     TARGET     is the name of the target body, the appearances of
                which in the specified instrument's field of view are
                sought. The body must be an ephemeris object.

                Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code
                for the body as a string. For example both 'MOON' and
                '301' are legitimate strings that designate the Moon.

                Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string TARGET.

                The input argument TARGET is used if and only if the
                target is NOT modeled as ray, as indicated by the
                input argument TSHAPE.

                TARGET may be set to a blank string if the target is
                modeled as a ray.


     TFRAME     is the name of the reference frame associated with the
                target. Examples of such names are 'IAU_SATURN'
                (for Saturn) and 'ITRF93' (for the Earth).

                If the target is an ephemeris object modeled as an
                ellipsoid, TFRAME must designate a body-fixed
                reference frame centered on the target body.

                If the target is an ephemeris object modeled as a
                point, TFRAME is ignored; TFRAME should be left blank.

                If the target is modeled as a ray, TFRAME may
                designate any reference frame. Since light time
                corrections are not supported for rays, the
                orientation of the frame is always evaluated at the
                epoch associated with the observer, as opposed to the
                epoch associated with the light-time corrected
                position of the frame center.
                
                Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
                non-blank frame name are not significant in the string
                TFRAME. 


     ABCORR     indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                when computing the target's position and orientation.
                The supported values of ABCORR depend on the target
                representation.

                If the target is represented by a ray, the aberration
                correction options are

                   'NONE'          No correction.
                   'S'             Stellar aberration correction,
                                   reception case.
                   'XS'            Stellar aberration correction,
                                   transmission case.

                If the target is an ephemeris object, the aberration
                correction options are those supported by the SPICE
                SPK system. For remote sensing applications, where the
                apparent position and orientation of the target seen
                by the observer are desired, normally either of the
                corrections
              
                   'LT+S' 
                   'CN+S'
     
                should be used. These and the other supported options
                are described below. 

                Supported aberration correction options for
                observation (the case where radiation is received by
                observer at ET) are:

                   'NONE'       No correction.
                   'LT'         Light time only
                   'LT+S'       Light time and stellar aberration.
                   'CN'         Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                   'CN+S'       CN light time and stellar aberration.

                Supported aberration correction options for
                transmission (the case where radiation is emitted from
                observer at ET) are:

                   'XLT'        Light time only.
                   'XLT+S'      Light time and stellar aberration.
                   'XCN'        Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                   'XCN+S'      CN light time and stellar aberration.

                For detailed information, see the geometry finder
                required reading, gf.req. 

                Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
                in the string ABCORR.
 

     OBSRVR     is the name of the body from which the target is
                observed. The instrument designated by INST is treated
                as if it were co-located with the observer.

                Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code
                for the body as a string.

                Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string OBSRVR.


     TOL        is a tolerance value used to determine convergence of
                root-finding operations. TOL is measured in TDB
                seconds and must be greater than zero.


     UDSTEP     is an externally specified routine that computes a
                time step used to find transitions of the state being
                considered. A state transition occurs where the state
                changes from being &quot;visible&quot; to being &quot;not visible&quot; or
                vice versa.
           
                This routine relies on UDSTEP returning step sizes
                small enough so that state transitions within the
                confinement window are not overlooked.

                The calling sequence for UDSTEP is:

                   CALL UDSTEP ( ET, STEP )

                where:

                   ET      is the input start time from which the
                           algorithm is to search forward for a state
                           transition. ET is expressed as seconds past
                           J2000 TDB. ET is a DOUBLE PRECISION number.

                   STEP    is the output step size.  STEP indicates
                           how far to advance ET so that ET and
                           ET+STEP may bracket a state transition and
                           definitely do not bracket more than one
                           state transition. STEP is a DOUBLE
                           PRECISION number. Units are TDB seconds.

                If a constant step size is desired, the routine <a href="gfstep.html">GFSTEP</a>
                may be used. If <a href="gfstep.html">GFSTEP</a> is used, the step size must be
                set by calling <a href="gfsstp.html">GFSSTP</a> prior to calling this routine.


     UDREFN     is the name of the externally specified routine that
                refines the times that bracket a transition point. In
                other words, once a pair of times, T1 and T2, that
                bracket a state transition have been found, UDREFN
                computes an intermediate time T such that either 
                [T1, T] or [T, T2] contains the time of the state
                transition. The calling sequence for UDREFN is:

                   CALL UDREFN ( T1, T2, S1, S2, T )

                where the inputs are:

                   T1    is a time when the visibility state is S1. T1
                         is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

                   T2    is a time when the visibility state is S2. T2
                         is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB. and
                         is assumed to be larger than T1.

                   S1    is the visibility state at time T1. S1 is a
                         LOGICAL value.

                   S2    is the visibility state at time T2. S2 is a
                         LOGICAL value.

                The output is:

                   T     is the next time to check for a state
                         transition. T is expressed as seconds past
                         J2000 TDB and is between T1 and T2.

                If a simple bisection method is desired, the routine
                <a href="gfrefn.html">GFREFN</a> may be used.  


     RPT        is a logical variable that controls whether
                progress reporting is enabled. When RPT is .TRUE.,
                progress reporting is enabled and the routines
                UDREPI, UDREPU, and UDPREF (see descriptions below)
                are used to report progress. 
 

     UDREPI     is a user-defined subroutine that initializes a
                progress report. When progress reporting is 
                enabled, UDREPI is called at the start
                of a search. The calling sequence of UDREPI is
 
                   UDREPI ( CNFINE, SRCPRE, SRCSUF )

                   DOUBLE PRECISION    CNFINE ( LBCELL : * )
                   CHARACTER*(*)       SRCPRE
                   CHARACTER*(*)       SRCSUF

                where

                   CNFINE 

                is the confinement window and
 
                   SRCPRE
                   SRCSUF

                are prefix and suffix strings used in the progress
                report: these strings are intended to bracket a
                representation of the fraction of work done.  For
                example, when the SPICELIB progress reporting functions
                are used, if SRCPRE and SRCSUF are, respectively,

                   'FOV search'
                   'done.'

                the progress report display at the end of the
                search will be:

                   FOV search 100.00% done.

                The SPICELIB routine <a href="gfrepi.html">GFREPI</a> may be used as the 
                actual argument corresponding to UDREPI. If so,
                the SPICELIB routines <a href="gfrepu.html">GFREPU</a> and <a href="gfrepf.html">GFREPF</a> must be
                the actual arguments corresponding to UDREPU and
                UDREPF.


     UDREPU     is a user-defined subroutine that updates the 
                progress report for a search.  The calling sequence 
                of UDREPU is
 
                   UDREPU ( IVBEG, IVEND, ET )

                   DOUBLE PRECISION      IVBEG
                   DOUBLE PRECISION      IVEND
                   DOUBLE PRECISION      ET  

                Here IVBEG, IVEND are the bounds of an interval that
                is contained in some interval belonging to the
                confinement window. The confinement window is
                associated with some root finding activity. It is used
                to determine how much total time is being searched in
                order to find the events of interest.

                ET is an epoch belonging to the interval [IVBEG,
                IVEND].

                In order for a meaningful progress report to be
                displayed, IVBEG and IVEND must satisfy the following
                constraints:

                 - IVBEG must be less than or equal to IVEND.

                 - The interval [ IVBEG, IVEND ] must be contained in
                   some interval of the confinement window. It can be
                   a proper subset of the containing interval; that
                   is, it can be smaller than the interval of the
                   confinement window that contains it.

                 - Over a search, the sum of the differences

                      IVEND - IVBEG

                   for all calls to this routine made during the search
                   must equal the measure of the confinement window.

                The SPICELIB routine <a href="gfrepu.html">GFREPU</a> may be used as the 
                actual argument corresponding to UDREPU. If so,
                the SPICELIB routines <a href="gfrepi.html">GFREPI</a> and <a href="gfrepf.html">GFREPF</a> must be
                the actual arguments corresponding to UDREPI and
                UDREPF.


     UDREPF     is a user-defined subroutine that finalizes a
                progress report. UDREPF has no arguments.

                The SPICELIB routine <a href="gfrepf.html">GFREPF</a> may be used as the 
                actual argument corresponding to UDREPF. If so,
                the SPICELIB routines <a href="gfrepi.html">GFREPI</a> and <a href="gfrepu.html">GFREPU</a> must be
                the actual arguments corresponding to UDREPI and
                UDREPU.


     BAIL       is a logical variable indicating whether or not
                interrupt handling is enabled. When BAIL is
                set to .TRUE., the input function UDBAIL (see
                description below) is used to determine whether
                an interrupt has been issued.


     UDBAIL     is the name of a user defined logical function that
                indicates whether an interrupt signal has been 
                issued (for example, from the keyboard).  UDBAIL
                has no arguments and returns a LOGICAL value.
                The return value is .TRUE. if an interrupt has
                been issued; otherwise the value is .FALSE.

                <b>GFFOVE</b> uses UDBAIL only when BAIL (see above) is set
                to .TRUE., indicating that interrupt handling is
                enabled. When interrupt handling is enabled, <b>GFFOVE</b>
                and routines in its call tree will call UDBAIL to
                determine whether to terminate processing and return
                immediately.
                
                If interrupt handing is not enabled, a logical
                function must still be passed to <b>GFFOVE</b> as
                an input argument. The SPICE function 

                   <a href="gfbail.html">GFBAIL</a>
        
                may be used for this purpose.


     CNFINE     is a SPICE window that confines the time period over
                which the specified search is conducted. CNFINE may
                consist of a single interval or a collection of 
                intervals. 

                The endpoints of the time intervals comprising CNFINE
                are interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.
                
                See the Examples section below for a code example 
                that shows how to create a confinement window.
                
                CNFINE must be initialized by the caller via the

     RESULT     is a SPICE window representing the set of time

                the specified instrument field of view.

     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
         that if the step size is non-positive, the error 
         SPICE(INVALIDSTEPSIZE) will be signaled.

     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

            - Truncation error in time values
            - Finite tolerance value
            - Errors in computed geometric quantities

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
         result window.

         The result window may need to be contracted slightly by the
         caller to achieve desired results. The SPICE window routine
         <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a> can be used to contract the result window.

     3)  If the name of either the target or observer cannot be
         translated to a NAIF ID code, the error will be diagnosed by
         a routine in the call tree of this routine.
         
     4)  If the specified aberration correction is not a supported
         value for the target type (ephemeris object or ray), the
         error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this
         routine.

     5)  If the radii of a target body modeled as an ellipsoid cannot
         be determined by searching the kernel pool for a kernel
         variable having a name of the form

            'BODYnnn_RADII' 

         where nnn represents the NAIF integer code associated with
         the body, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine.

     6)  If the target body coincides with the observer body OBSRVR,
         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.
         
     7)  If the body model specifier TSHAPE is not recognized, the
         error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this
         routine.

     8)  If a target body-fixed reference frame associated with a 
         non-point target is not recognized, the error will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     9)  If a target body-fixed reference frame is not centered at
         the corresponding target body,  the error will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     10) If the instrument name INST does not have corresponding NAIF
         ID code, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     11) If the FOV parameters of the instrument are not present in
         the kernel pool, the error will be be diagnosed by routines
         in the call tree of this routine.

     12) If the FOV boundary has more than MAXVRT vertices, the error
         will be be diagnosed by routines in the call tree of this
         routine.

     13) If the instrument FOV is polygonal, and this routine cannot
         find a ray R emanating from the FOV vertex such that maximum
         angular separation of R and any FOV boundary vector is within
         the limit (pi/2)-SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians, the error will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If
         the FOV is any other shape, the same error check will be
         applied with the instrument boresight vector serving the role
         of R.

     14) If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute a
         requested state vector, the error will be diagnosed by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine.

     15) If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,
         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree 
         of this routine.

     16) If the output SPICE window RESULT has insufficient capacity
         to contain the number of intervals on which the specified
         visibility condition is met, the error will be diagnosed
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If the result
         window has size less than 2, the error SPICE(WINDOWTOOSMALL)
         will be signaled by this routine.

     17) If the convergence tolerance size is non-positive, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDTOLERANCE) will be signaled.

     18) If the step size is non-positive, the error 
         SPICE(INVALIDSTEP) will be signaled. 

     19) If the ray's direction vector is zero, the error 
         SPICE(ZEROVECTOR) is signaled.

     Appropriate SPICE ernels must be loaded by the calling program
     before this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data:  ephemeris data for target and observer that 
          describes the ephemeris of these objects for the period
          defined by the confinement window, 'CNFINE' must be
          loaded.  If aberration corrections are used, the states of
          target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
          must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.
          Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one
          or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Frame data:  if a frame definition is required to convert
          the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of
          the target, that definition must be available in the kernel
          pool. Typically the definitions of frames not already
          built-in to SPICE are supplied by loading a frame kernel.

          Data defining the reference frame associated with the
          instrument designated by INST must be available in the kernel
          pool. Additionally the name INST must be associated with an
          ID code. Normally these data are  made available by loading
          a frame kernel via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - IK data: the kernel pool must contain data such that
          the SPICELIB routine <a href="getfov.html">GETFOV</a> may be called to obtain
          parameters for INST. Normally such data are provided by
          an IK via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

     The following data may be required:

        - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
          orientation data provided by variables in the kernel pool.
          Typically these data are made available by loading a text
          PCK file via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

          Bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have semi-axis
          lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool. Typically
          these data are made available by loading a text PCK file via
          <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - CK data: if the instrument frame is fixed to a spacecraft,
          at least one CK file will be needed to permit transformation
          of vectors between that frame and both J2000 and the target
          body-fixed frame.

        - SCLK data:  if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
          kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
          (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
          (TDB).

        - Since the input ray direction may be expressed in any 
          frame, FKs, CKs, SCLK kernels, PCKs, and SPKs may be
          required to map the direction to the J2000 frame.

     Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every
     time this routine is called.

     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
     within the confinement window when a specified ray or any portion
     of a specified target body appears within the field of view of a
     specified instrument. We'll use the term &quot;visibility event&quot; to
     designate such an appearance. The set of time intervals resulting
     from the search is returned as a SPICE window.

     This routine provides the SPICE GF system's most flexible
     interface for searching for FOV intersection events.

     Applications that require do not require support for progress
     reporting, interrupt handling, non-default step or refinement
     functions, or non-default convergence tolerance normally should
     call either <a href="gftfov.html">GFTFOV</a> or <a href="gfrfov.html">GFRFOV</a> rather than this routine.

     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient use
     of this routine in user applications.


     The Search Process
     ==================

     The search for visibility events is treated as a search for state
     transitions: times are sought when the state of the target ray or
     body changes from &quot;not visible&quot; to &quot;visible&quot; or vice versa.

     Step Size
     =========

     Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows:
     first, the input step size is used to determine the time
     separation at which the visibility state will be sampled.
     Starting at the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be
     taken at each step. If a state change is detected, a root has
     been bracketed; at that point, the &quot;root&quot;--the time at which the
     state change occurs---is found by a refinement process, for
     example, via binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the visibility state is constant:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest visibility event
     duration and the shortest period between visibility events, within
     the confinement window.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target and
     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
     time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     The times of state transitions are called ``roots.''

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; 

     The convergence tolerance used by high-level GF routines that
     call this routine is set via the parameter CNVTOL, which is
     declared in the INCLUDE file gf.inc. The value of CNVTOL is set
     to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the tolerance doesn't become the
     limiting factor in the accuracy of solutions found by this
     routine. In general the accuracy of input data will be the
     limiting factor.

     Setting the input tolerance TOL tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely
     to be useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect on
     processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed. For an example, see
     the program CASCADE in the GF Example Programs chapter of the GF
     Required Reading, gf.req.

     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine 
     specific arithmetic implementation. 


     1) Search for times when Saturn's satellite Phoebe is within
        the FOV of the Cassini narrow angle camera (CASSINI_ISS_NAC).
        To simplify the problem, restrict the search to a short time
        period where continuous Cassini bus attitude data are
        available.

        Use default SPICELIB progress reporting.

        Use a step size of 1 second to reduce chances of missing
        short visibility events and to make the search slow enough
        so the progress report's updates are visible.
        
        Use the meta-kernel shown below to load the required SPICE
        kernels.

           This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
           example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
           assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
           required by SPICE-based user applications.

           In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
           kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
           current working directory.

           The names and contents of the kernels referenced
           by this meta-kernel are as follows:

     2)  A variation of example (1): search the same confinement
         window for times when a selected background star is visible.
         We use the FOV of the Cassini ISS wide angle camera
         (CASSINI_ISS_WAC) to enhance the probability of viewing the
         star.

         The star we'll use has catalog number 6000 in the Hipparcos
         Catalog. The star's J2000 right ascension and declination,
         proper motion, and parallax are taken from that catalog.

         Use the meta-kernel from the first example.
