<h4><a name="Detailed_Input">Detailed_Input</a></h4>
<PRE>
     TARG        is the NAIF ID code for a target body.  The target
                 and observer define a state vector whose position
                 component points from the observer to the target.

     ET          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past J2000
                 TDB, at which the state of the target body relative to
                 the observer is to be computed.  ET refers to time at
                 the observer's location.

     REF         is the inertial reference frame with respect to which
                 the observer's state SOBS is expressed. REF must be
                 recognized by the SPICE Toolkit.  The acceptable
                 frames are listed in the Frames Required Reading, as
                 well as in the SPICELIB routine <a href="chgirf.html">CHGIRF</a>.

                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string REF.

     SOBS        is the geometric (uncorrected) state of the observer
                 relative to the solar system barycenter at epoch ET.
                 SOBS is a 6-vector:  the first three components of
                 SOBS represent a Cartesian position vector; the last
                 three components represent the corresponding velocity
                 vector.  SOBS is expressed relative to the inertial
                 reference frame designated by REF.

                 Units are always km and km/sec.

     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                 to the state of the target body to account for one-way
                 light time and stellar aberration.  See the discussion
                 in the Particulars section for recommendations on 
                 how to choose aberration corrections.
                  
                 ABCORR may be any of the following:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the 
                               geometric state of the target body 
                               relative to the observer.  

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                               called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                               Newtonian formulation. This correction
                               yields the state of the target at the
                               moment it emitted photons arriving at
                               the observer at ET.
 
                               The light time correction involves
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation (see Particulars for details).
                               The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                               uses one iteration.

                    'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                               stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This option modifies the
                               state obtained with the 'LT' option to
                               account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The result is the apparent
                               state of the target---the position and
                               velocity of the target as seen by the
                               observer.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges (three
                               iterations on all supported platforms).
                               Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                               substantially more accurate than the
                               'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                               of the participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed. See the Particulars section
                               of <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a discussion of precision
                               of light time corrections.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction and stellar aberration
                               correction.


                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
                 the observer's location at ET and arrive at the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET+LT:

                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This correction yields the
                               state of the target at the moment it
                               receives photons emitted from the
                               observer's location at ET.

                    'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time and stellar
                               aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation  This option modifies the
                               state obtained with the 'XLT' option to
                               account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The position component of
                               the computed target state indicates the
                               direction that photons emitted from the
                               observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to
                               hit the target.

                    'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged 
                               Newtonian light time correction.

                    'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                               Newtonian light time correction and
                               stellar aberration correction.

                 Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
                 accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
                 by this routine.

<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>

     STARG       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position
                 and velocity of the target body relative to the
                 specified observer. STARG is corrected for the
                 specified aberrations, and is expressed with respect
                 to the specified inertial reference frame.  The first
                 three components of STARG represent the x-, y- and
                 z-components of the target's position; last three
                 components form the corresponding velocity vector.

                 The position component of STARG points from the
                 observer's location at ET to the aberration-corrected
                 location of the target. Note that the sense of the
                 position vector is independent of the direction of
                 radiation travel implied by the aberration
                 correction.

                 The velocity component of STARG is obtained by
                 evaluating the target's geometric state at the light
                 time corrected epoch, so for aberration-corrected
                 states, the velocity is not precisely equal to the
                 time derivative of the position.

                 Units are always km and km/sec.

     LT          is the one-way light time between the observer and
                 target in seconds.  If the target state is corrected
                 for aberrations, then LT is the one-way light time 
                 between the observer and the light time corrected 
                 target location.

<h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4>
<PRE>
     This routine computes states using SPK files that have been
     loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading
     interface routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.  Application programs typically load
     kernels once before this routine is called, for example during
     program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly.
     See the routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading
     for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels.

     If any of the ephemeris data used to compute STARG are expressed
     relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those
     data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference
     frame transformations required to compute the state.  Normally
     these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels.  Any
     such kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is
     called.

     In space science or engineering applications one frequently
     wishes to know where to point a remote sensing instrument, such
     as an optical camera or radio antenna, in order to observe or
     otherwise receive radiation from a target.  This pointing problem
     is complicated by the finite speed of light:  one needs to point
     to where the target appears to be as opposed to where it actually
     is at the epoch of observation.  We use the adjectives
     &quot;geometric,&quot; &quot;uncorrected,&quot; or &quot;true&quot; to refer to an actual
     position or state of a target at a specified epoch.  When a
     geometric position or state vector is modified to reflect how it
     appears to an observer, we describe that vector by any of the
     terms &quot;apparent,&quot; &quot;corrected,&quot; &quot;aberration corrected,&quot; or &quot;light
     time and stellar aberration corrected.&quot;

     The SPICE Toolkit can correct for two phenomena affecting the
     apparent location of an object:  one-way light time (also called
     &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) and stellar aberration.  Correcting for
     one-way light time is done by computing, given an observer and
     observation epoch, where a target was when the observed photons
     departed the target's location.  The vector from the observer to
     this computed target location is called a &quot;light time corrected&quot;
     vector.  The light time correction depends on the motion of the
     target, but it is independent of the velocity of the observer
     relative to the solar system barycenter. Relativistic effects
     such as light bending and gravitational delay are not accounted
     for in the light time correction performed by this routine.

     The velocity of the observer also affects the apparent location
     of a target:  photons arriving at the observer are subject to a
     &quot;raindrop effect&quot; whereby their velocity relative to the observer
     is, using a Newtonian approximation, the photons' velocity
     relative to the solar system barycenter minus the velocity of the
     observer relative to the solar system barycenter.  This effect is
     called &quot;stellar aberration.&quot;  Stellar aberration is independent
     of the velocity of the target.  The stellar aberration formula
     used by this routine is non-relativistic.

     Stellar aberration corrections are applied after light time
     corrections:  the light time corrected target position vector is 
     used as an input to the stellar aberration correction.

     When light time and stellar aberration corrections are both
     applied to a geometric position vector, the resulting position 
     vector indicates where the target &quot;appears to be&quot; from the
     observer's location.  

     As opposed to computing the apparent position of a target, one
     may wish to compute the pointing direction required for 
     transmission of photons to the target.  This requires correction
     of the geometric target position for the effects of light time and
     stellar aberration, but in this case the corrections are computed
     for radiation traveling from the observer to the target. 

     The &quot;transmission&quot; light time correction yields the target's
     location as it will be when photons emitted from the observer's
     location at ET arrive at the target.  The transmission stellar
     aberration correction is the inverse of the traditional stellar
     aberration correction:  it indicates the direction in which
     radiation should be emitted so that, using a Newtonian
     approximation, the sum of the velocity of the radiation relative
     to the observer and of the observer's velocity, relative to the 
     solar system barycenter, yields a velocity vector that points in 
     the direction of the light time corrected position of the target.
   
     The traditional aberration corrections applicable to observation 
     and those applicable to transmission are related in a simple way:
     one may picture the geometry of the &quot;transmission&quot; case by 
     imagining the &quot;observation&quot; case running in reverse time order,
     and vice versa.  

     One may reasonably object to using the term &quot;observer&quot; in the
     transmission case, in which radiation is emitted from the
     observer's location.  The terminology was retained for
     consistency with earlier documentation.

     Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some
     common applications:

        1) Find the apparent direction of a target for a remote-sensing
           observation.

              Use 'LT+S' or 'CN+S: apply both light time and stellar 
              aberration corrections.

           Note that using light time corrections alone ('LT' or 'CN')
           is generally not a good way to obtain an approximation to
           an apparent target vector: since light time and stellar
           aberration corrections often partially cancel each other,
           it may be more accurate to use no correction at all than to
           use light time alone.


        2) Find the corrected pointing direction to radiate a signal
           to a target. This computation is often applicable for 
           implementing communications sessions.

              Use 'XLT+S' or 'XCN+S: apply both light time and stellar 
              aberration corrections for transmission.


        3) Compute the apparent position of a target body relative
           to a star or other distant object.

              Use 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', or 'CN+S' as needed to match the
              correction applied to the position of the distant
              object. For example, if a star position is obtained from
              a catalog, the position vector may not be corrected for
              stellar aberration. In this case, to find the angular
              separation of the star and the limb of a planet, the
              vector from the observer to the planet should be
              corrected for light time but not stellar aberration.


        4) Obtain an uncorrected state vector derived directly from 
           data in an SPK file.

              Use 'NONE'.
C

        5) Use a geometric state vector as a low-accuracy estimate
           of the apparent state for an application where execution 
           speed is critical:

              Use 'NONE'.


        6) While this routine cannot perform the relativistic
           aberration corrections required to compute states
           with the highest possible accuracy, it can supply the
           geometric states required as inputs to these computations:

              Use 'NONE', then apply high-accuracy aberration
              corrections (not available in the SPICE Toolkit).


     Below, we discuss in more detail how the aberration corrections
     applied by this routine are computed.     


     Geometric case
     ==============

        <b>SPKAPP</b> begins by computing the geometric position T(ET) of the
        target body relative to the solar system barycenter (SSB).
        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(ET) gives
        the geometric position of the target body relative to the
        observer. The one-way light time, LT, is given by

                  | T(ET) - O(ET) |
           LT = -------------------
                          c

        The geometric relationship between the observer, target, and
        solar system barycenter is as shown:


           SSB ---&gt; O(ET)
            |      /
            |     /
            |    /                           
            |   /  T(ET) - O(ET)  
            V  V                                  
           T(ET)


        The returned state consists of the position vector

           T(ET) - O(ET)

        and a velocity obtained by taking the difference of the
        corresponding velocities.  In the geometric case, the 
        returned velocity is actually the time derivative of the 
        position.


     Reception case
     ==============

        When any of the options 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', 'CN+S' is
        selected, <b>SPKAPP</b> computes the position of the target body at
        epoch ET-LT, where LT is the one-way light time.  Let T(t) and
        O(t) represent the positions of the target and observer
        relative to the solar system barycenter at time t; then LT is
        the solution of the light-time equation

                  | T(ET-LT) - O(ET) |
           LT = ------------------------                            (1)
                           c

        The ratio 

            | T(ET) - O(ET) |
          ---------------------                                     (2)
                    c

        is used as a first approximation to LT; inserting (2) into the
        RHS of the light-time equation (1) yields the &quot;one-iteration&quot;
        estimate of the one-way light time. Repeating the process
        until the estimates of LT converge yields the &quot;converged
        Newtonian&quot; light time estimate.
       
        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(ET) gives
        the position of the target body relative to the observer:
        T(ET-LT) - O(ET).

           SSB ---&gt; O(ET)
            | \     |
            |  \    |
            |   \   | T(ET-LT) - O(ET)
            |    \  |
            V     V V
           T(ET)  T(ET-LT)
        
        The position component of the light-time corrected state 
        is the vector

           T(ET-LT) - O(ET)

        The velocity component of the light-time corrected state 
        is the difference

           T_vel(ET-LT) - O_vel(ET)
            
        where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of
        the target and observer relative to the solar system 
        barycenter at the epochs ET-LT and ET.

        If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
        position is rotated toward the solar system barycenter-
        relative velocity vector of the observer. The rotation is
        computed as follows:

           Let r be the light time corrected vector from the observer
           to the object, and v be the velocity of the observer with
           respect to the solar system barycenter. Let w be the angle
           between them. The aberration angle phi is given by

              sin(phi) = v sin(w) / c

           Let h be the vector given by the cross product

              h = r X v

           Rotate r by phi radians about h to obtain the apparent
           position of the object.

        The velocity component of the output state STARG is 
        not corrected for stellar aberration.


     Transmission case
     ==================

        When any of the options 'XLT', 'XCN', 'XLT+S', 'XCN+S' are
        selected, <b>SPKAPP</b> computes the position of the target body T at
        epoch ET+LT, where LT is the one-way light time.  LT is the
        solution of the light-time equation

                  | T(ET+LT) - O(ET) |
           LT = ------------------------                            (3)
                            c

        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer, O(ET),
        gives the position of the target body relative to the
        observer: T(ET-LT) - O(ET).

                   SSB --&gt; O(ET)
                  / |    * 
                 /  |  *  T(ET+LT) - O(ET)  
                /   |*     
               /   *|    
              V  V  V     
          T(ET+LT)  T(ET)    

        The position component of the light-time corrected state 
        is the vector

           T(ET+LT) - O(ET)

        The velocity component of the light-time corrected state 
        is the difference

           T_vel(ET+LT) - O_vel(ET)
            
        where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of
        the target and observer relative to the solar system 
        barycenter at the epochs ET+LT and ET.

        If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
        position is rotated away from the solar system barycenter-
        relative velocity vector of the observer. The rotation is
        computed as in the reception case, but the sign of the
        rotation angle is negated.

        The velocity component of the output state STARG is 
        not corrected for stellar aberration.

     Neither special nor general relativistic effects are accounted 
     for in the aberration corrections performed by this routine.
