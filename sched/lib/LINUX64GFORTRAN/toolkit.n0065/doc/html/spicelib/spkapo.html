<h4><a name="Detailed_Input">Detailed_Input</a></h4>
<PRE>
     TARG        is the NAIF ID code for a target body.  The target
                 and observer define a position vector which points
                 from the observer to the target.

     ET          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past
                 J2000 TDB, at which the position of the target body
                 relative to the observer is to be computed.  ET
                 refers to time at the observer's location.

     REF         is the inertial reference frame with respect to which
                 the observer's state SOBS is expressed. REF must be
                 recognized by the SPICE Toolkit.  The acceptable
                 frames are listed in the Frames Required Reading, as
                 well as in the SPICELIB routine <a href="chgirf.html">CHGIRF</a>.

                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string REF.

     SOBS        is the geometric (uncorrected) state of the observer
                 relative to the solar system barycenter at epoch ET.
                 SOBS is a 6-vector:  the first three components of
                 SOBS represent a Cartesian position vector; the last
                 three components represent the corresponding velocity
                 vector.  SOBS is expressed relative to the inertial
                 reference frame designated by REF.

                 Units are always km and km/sec.


     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
                 the position of the target body to account for
                 one-way light time and stellar aberration.  See the
                 discussion in the Particulars section for
                 recommendations on how to choose aberration
                 corrections.

                 ABCORR may be any of the following:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the 
                               geometric position of the target body 
                               relative to the observer.  

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                               called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                               Newtonian formulation. This correction
                               yields the position of the target at the
                               moment it emitted photons arriving at
                               the observer at ET.
 
                               The light time correction involves
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation (see Particulars for details).
                               The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                               uses one iteration.

                    'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                               stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This option modifies the
                               position obtained with the 'LT' option
                               to account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The result is the apparent
                               position of the target---the position
                               of the target as seen by the observer.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges (three
                               iterations on all supported platforms).
                               Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                               substantially more accurate than the
                               'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                               of the participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed. See the Particulars section
                               of <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a discussion of precision
                               of light time corrections.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction and stellar aberration
                               correction.


                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
                 the observer's location at ET and arrive at the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET+LT:

                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This correction yields the
                               position of the target at the moment it
                               receives photons emitted from the
                               observer's location at ET.

                    'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time and stellar
                               aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation  This option modifies the
                               position obtained with the 'XLT' option
                               to account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The target position
                               indicates the direction that photons
                               emitted from the observer's location
                               must be &quot;aimed&quot; to hit the target.

                    'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged 
                               Newtonian light time correction.

                    'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                               Newtonian light time correction and
                               stellar aberration correction.

                 Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
                 accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
                 by this routine.

<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     PTARG       is a Cartesian 3-vector representing the position of
                 the target body relative to the specified observer.
                 PTARG is corrected for the specified aberrations, and
                 is expressed with respect to the specified inertial
                 reference frame.  The components of PTARG represent
                 the x-, y- and z-components of the target's position.

                 The vector PTARG points from the observer's position
                 at ET to the aberration-corrected location of the
                 target. Note that the sense of the position vector is
                 independent of the direction of radiation travel
                 implied by the aberration correction.

                 Units are always km.

     LT          is the one-way light time between the observer and
                 target in seconds.  If the target position is 
                 corrected for aberrations, then LT is the one-way
                 light time between the observer and the light time
                 corrected target location.

<h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4>

     This routine computes positions using SPK files that have been
     loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading
     interface routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.  Application programs typically load
     kernels once before this routine is called, for example during
     program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly.
     See the routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading
     for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels.

     If any of the ephemeris data used to compute PTARG are expressed
     relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those
     data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference
     frame transformations required to compute PTARG.  Normally
     these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels.  Any
     such kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is
     called.

     In space science or engineering applications one frequently
     wishes to know where to point a remote sensing instrument, such
     as an optical camera or radio antenna, in order to observe or
     otherwise receive radiation from a target.  This pointing problem
     is complicated by the finite speed of light:  one needs to point
     to where the target appears to be as opposed to where it actually
     is at the epoch of observation.  We use the adjectives
     &quot;geometric,&quot; &quot;uncorrected,&quot; or &quot;true&quot; to refer to an actual
     position or state of a target at a specified epoch.  When a
     geometric position or state vector is modified to reflect how it
     appears to an observer, we describe that vector by any of the
     terms &quot;apparent,&quot; &quot;corrected,&quot; &quot;aberration corrected,&quot; or &quot;light
     time and stellar aberration corrected.&quot;

     The SPICE Toolkit can correct for two phenomena affecting the
     apparent location of an object:  one-way light time (also called
     &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) and stellar aberration.  Correcting for
     one-way light time is done by computing, given an observer and
     observation epoch, where a target was when the observed photons
     departed the target's location.  The vector from the observer to
     this computed target location is called a &quot;light time corrected&quot;
     vector.  The light time correction depends on the motion of the
     target, but it is independent of the velocity of the observer
     relative to the solar system barycenter. Relativistic effects
     such as light bending and gravitational delay are not accounted
     for in the light time correction performed by this routine.

     The velocity of the observer also affects the apparent location
     of a target:  photons arriving at the observer are subject to a
     &quot;raindrop effect&quot; whereby their velocity relative to the observer
     is, using a Newtonian approximation, the photons' velocity
     relative to the solar system barycenter minus the velocity of the
     observer relative to the solar system barycenter.  This effect is
     called &quot;stellar aberration.&quot;  Stellar aberration is independent
     of the motion of the target.  The stellar aberration formula used
     by this routine is non- relativistic.

     Stellar aberration corrections are applied after light time
     corrections:  the light time corrected target position vector is 
     used as an input to the stellar aberration correction.

     When light time and stellar aberration corrections are both
     applied to a geometric position vector, the resulting position 
     vector indicates where the target &quot;appears to be&quot; from the
     observer's location.  

     As opposed to computing the apparent position of a target, one
     may wish to compute the pointing direction required for 
     transmission of photons to the target.  This requires correction
     of the geometric target position for the effects of light time and
     stellar aberration, but in this case the corrections are computed
     for radiation traveling from the observer to the target. 

     The &quot;transmission&quot; light time correction yields the target's
     location as it will be when photons emitted from the observer's
     location at ET arrive at the target.  The transmission stellar
     aberration correction is the inverse of the traditional stellar
     aberration correction:  it indicates the direction in which
     radiation should be emitted so that, using a Newtonian
     approximation, the sum of the velocity of the radiation relative
     to the observer and of the observer's velocity, relative to the 
     solar system barycenter, yields a velocity vector that points in 
     the direction of the light time corrected position of the target.
   
     The traditional aberration corrections applicable to observation 
     and those applicable to transmission are related in a simple way:
     one may picture the geometry of the &quot;transmission&quot; case by 
     imagining the &quot;observation&quot; case running in reverse time order,
     and vice versa.  

     One may reasonably object to using the term &quot;observer&quot; in the
     transmission case, in which radiation is emitted from the
     observer's location.  The terminology was retained for
     consistency with earlier documentation.

     Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some
     common applications:

        1) Find the apparent direction of a target for a remote-sensing
           observation.

              Use 'LT+S' or 'CN+S: apply both light time and stellar 
              aberration corrections.

           Note that using light time corrections alone ('LT' or 'CN')
           is generally not a good way to obtain an approximation to
           an apparent target vector: since light time and stellar
           aberration corrections often partially cancel each other,
           it may be more accurate to use no correction at all than to
           use light time alone.


        2) Find the corrected pointing direction to radiate a signal
           to a target. This computation is often applicable for 
           implementing communications sessions.

              Use 'XLT+S' or 'XCN+S: apply both light time and stellar 
              aberration corrections for transmission.


        3) Compute the apparent position of a target body relative
           to a star or other distant object.

              Use 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', or 'CN+S' as needed to match the
              correction applied to the position of the distant
              object. For example, if a star position is obtained from
              a catalog, the position vector may not be corrected for
              stellar aberration. In this case, to find the angular
              separation of the star and the limb of a planet, the
              vector from the observer to the planet should be
              corrected for light time but not stellar aberration.


        4) Obtain an uncorrected state vector derived directly from 
           data in an SPK file.

              Use 'NONE'.


        5) Use a geometric position vector as a low-accuracy estimate
           of the apparent position for an application where execution
           speed is critical:

              Use 'NONE'.


        6) While this routine cannot perform the relativistic
           aberration corrections required to compute positions
           with the highest possible accuracy, it can supply the
           geometric positions required as inputs to these 
           computations:

              Use 'NONE', then apply high-accuracy aberration
              corrections (not available in the SPICE Toolkit).


     Below, we discuss in more detail how the aberration corrections
     applied by this routine are computed.     


     Geometric case
     ==============

        <b>SPKAPO</b> begins by computing the geometric position T(ET) of the
        target body relative to the solar system barycenter (SSB).
        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(ET) gives
        the geometric position of the target body relative to the
        observer. The one-way light time, LT, is given by

                  | T(ET) - O(ET) |
           LT = -------------------
                          c

        The geometric relationship between the observer, target, and
        solar system barycenter is as shown:


           SSB ---&gt; O(ET)
            |      /
            |     /
            |    /                           
            |   /  T(ET) - O(ET)  
            V  V                                  
           T(ET)


        The returned position vector is

           T(ET) - O(ET)


     Reception case
     ==============

        When any of the options 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', 'CN+S' are
        selected, <b>SPKAPO</b> computes the position of the target body at
        epoch ET-LT, where LT is the one-way light time.  Let T(t)
        and O(t) represent the positions of the target and observer
        relative to the solar system barycenter at time t; then LT 
        is the solution of the
        light-time equation

                  | T(ET-LT) - O(ET) |
           LT = ------------------------                            (1)
                           c

        The ratio 

            | T(ET) - O(ET) |
          ---------------------                                     (2)
                    c

        is used as a first approximation to LT; inserting (2) into the
        RHS of the light-time equation (1) yields the &quot;one-iteration&quot;
        estimate of the one-way light time. Repeating the process
        until the estimates of LT converge yields the &quot;converged
        Newtonian&quot; light time estimate.
       
        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(ET) gives
        the position of the target body relative to the observer:
        T(ET-LT) - O(ET).

           SSB ---&gt; O(ET)
            | \     |
            |  \    |
            |   \   | T(ET-LT) - O(ET)
            |    \  |
            V     V V
           T(ET)  T(ET-LT)

        
        The light-time corrected position is the vector

           T(ET-LT) - O(ET)

        If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
        position is rotated toward the solar system barycenter-relative
        velocity vector of the observer. The magnitude of the rotation
        depends on the magnitude of the observer's velocity relative
        to the solar system barycenter and the angle between 
        this velocity and the observer-target vector.  The rotation
        is computed as follows:

           Let r be the light time corrected vector from the observer
           to the object, and v be the velocity of the observer with
           respect to the solar system barycenter. Let w be the angle
           between them. The aberration angle phi is given by

              sin(phi) = v sin(w) / c

           Let h be the vector given by the cross product

              h = r X v

           Rotate r by phi radians about h to obtain the apparent
           position of the object.



     Transmission case
     ==================

        When any of the options 'XLT', 'XCN', 'XLT+S', 'XCN+S' are
        selected, <b>SPKAPO</b> computes the position of the target body T at
        epoch ET+LT, where LT is the one-way light time.  LT is the
        solution of the light-time equation

                  | T(ET+LT) - O(ET) |
           LT = ------------------------                            (3)
                            c

        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer, O(ET),
        gives the position of the target body relative to the
        observer: T(ET-LT) - O(ET).

                   SSB --&gt; O(ET)
                  / |    * 
                 /  |  *  T(ET+LT) - O(ET)  
                /   |*     
               /   *|    
              V  V  V     
          T(ET+LT)  T(ET)    


        The light-time corrected position is 

           T(ET+LT) - O(ET)

        If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
        position is rotated away from the solar system barycenter-
        relative velocity vector of the observer.  The magnitude of the
        rotation depends on the magnitude of the velocity and the
        angle between the velocity and the observer-target vector.
        The rotation is computed as in the reception case, but the
        sign of the rotation angle is negated.

     Neither special nor general relativistic effects are accounted 
     for in the aberration corrections performed by this routine.

     In the following code fragment, <a href="spkssb.html">SPKSSB</a> and <b>SPKAPO</b> are used
     to display the position of Io (body 501) as seen from the 
     Voyager 2 spacecraft (Body -32) at a series of epochs.

     Normally, one would call the high-level reader <a href="spkpos.html">SPKPOS</a> to obtain
     position vectors.  The example below illustrates the interface
     of this routine, but is not intended as a recommendation on
     how to use the SPICE SPK subsystem.

     The use of integer ID codes is necessitated by the low-level
     interface of this routine.

        IO    = 501
        VGR2  = -32

        DO WHILE ( EPOCH .LE. END )

           CALL <a href="spkssb.html">SPKSSB</a> (  VGR2,  EPOCH, 'J2000', STVGR2  )
           CALL <b>SPKAPO</b> (  IO,    EPOCH, 'J2000', STVGR2,
       .                 'LT+S', STIO,   LT              )

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>

     1) The ephemeris files to be used by <b>SPKAPO</b> must be loaded
        (normally by the SPICELIB kernel loader <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>) before 
        this routine is called.

     2) Unlike most other SPK position computation routines, this
        routine requires that the input state be relative to an
        inertial reference frame.  Non-inertial frames are not
        supported by this routine.

     3) In a future version of this routine, the implementation 
        of the aberration corrections may be enhanced to improve
        accuracy.
