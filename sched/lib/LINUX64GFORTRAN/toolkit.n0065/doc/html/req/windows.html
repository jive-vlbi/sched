   SPICE Toolkits define the SPICE data type "window" for use in the
   manipulation of continuous intervals on the real line. Corresponding
   window routines in SPICELIB are designed to simplify the use of this
   data type.

<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   By definition, a window is a double precision SPICE cell that contains
   zero or more intervals.
<P>
 
   An interval is an ordered pair of numbers,
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [ a(i), b(i) ]
</PRE>
   such that
<P>
 
<PRE>
   a(i)  &lt;  b(i)
         -
</PRE>
   The intervals within a window are both ordered and disjoint. That is,
   the beginning of each interval is greater than the end of the previous
   interval:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   b(i)  &lt;  a(i+1)
</PRE>
   This restriction is enforced primarily because it allows efficient
   window operations.
<P>
 
   The intervals stored in windows typically represent intervals of time
   (seconds, days, or centuries past a reference epoch). However, windows
   can represent any kinds of intervals.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Basic Concepts"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Basic Concepts
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   ``size'' - The maximum number of elements storable in a SPICE cell.
   Cells are created with a constant size.
<P>
 
   ``cardinality - The number of elements stored in a cell. ``cardinality''
   describes how much of ``size'' is used. ``cardinality'' satisfies the
   relationship:
<P>
 
<PRE>
      cardinality &lt; size
                  -
</PRE>
   ``measure'' - the measure of an interval is the length of the interval,
   that is the difference of its endpoints:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   m(i) = b(i) - a(i)
</PRE>
   Note that the singleton interval
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [ a(i), a(i) ]
</PRE>
   has measure zero. The window
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [1,2], [4,9], [16,16]
</PRE>
   contains intervals of measure 1, 5, and 0 respectively.
<P>
 
   The concept of measure extends readily to the gaps between adjacent
   intervals. In the example above, the window contains gaps of measure 2
   and 7. Intervals separated by gaps of measure zero or less are said to
   overlap. Overlapping intervals created by the window routines are merged
   as soon as they are created.
<P>
 
   Finally, the measure of a window is the sum of the measures of its
   intervals. In the example above, the measure of the window is 6. Note
   that a floating point window containing only singletons has measure
   zero.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="The window data type"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> The window data type
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   SPICE windows are a form of the SPICE cell data type [1], so any
   restriction that applies to the use of cells applies to the use of
   windows as well. The implementation of a SPICE window differs according
   to the Toolkit language.
<P>
 
   The SPICELIB implementation of SPICE windows consists of Fortran double
   precision cells.
<P>
 
   Example:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   C
   C     Define our variable types.
   C
         INTEGER           LBCELL
         PARAMETER        (LBCELL = -5 )
 
         INTEGER           MAXSIZ
         PARAMETER        (MAXSIZ = 8 )
 
   C
   C     Define a cell WIN to use as a window.
   C
   C     The window can hold eight (MAXSIZ = 8) double precision values,
   C     thus four intervals.
   C
         DOUBLE PRECISION  WIN(LBCELL:MAXSIZ)
</PRE>
   The cell size, `MAXSIZ', must have an even value to use the cell as a
   window. Two values define a window interval, so a window of N intervals
   requires a cell of size 2*N.
<P>
 
   The size and cardinality of a window must be initialized (using the cell
   routines <a href="../spicelib/ssized.html">SSIZED</a> and <a href="../spicelib/scardd.html">SCARDD</a>) before the window may be used by any of the
   SPICELIB window routines.
<P>
 
   Any of the general cell routines in SPICELIB may be used with SPICE
   windows. For example, <a href="../spicelib/copyd.html">COPYD</a> may be used to copy the contents of one
   window into another. The function <a href="../spicelib/cardd.html">CARDD</a> may be used to determine the
   number of endpoints (that is, twice the number of intervals) in a
   window.
<P>
 
   All errors are reported via standard SPICELIB error handling.
<P>
 
   With the exception of the initialization routines, all window routines
   assume that input cells do contain valid windows---that is, ordered and
   distinct sets of endpoints. The windows subsystem may not signal errors
   resulting from attempts to operate on invalid windows.

   <a href="../spicelib/wnvald.html">WNVALD</a> takes as input a double precision SPICE cell containing pairs of
   endpoints and validates it to form a window. The calling sequence is
   shown below.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../spicelib/wnvald.html">WNVALD</a> ( SIZE, N, WINDOW )
</PRE>
   On input, WINDOW is a cell of size SIZE containing N endpoints. During
   validation, the intervals are ordered, and overlapping intervals are
   merged. On output, the cardinality of WINDOW is the number of endpoints
   remaining, and the window is ready for use with any of the window
   routines.
<P>
 
   Because validation is done in place, there is no chance of overflow.
   However, other errors may be detected. For example, if the left endpoint
   of any interval is greater than the corresponding right endpoint, <a href="../spicelib/wnvald.html">WNVALD</a>
   signals an error.
<P>
 
   Validation is primarily useful for ordering and merging intervals added
   to a cell by <a href="../spicelib/appndd.html">APPNDD</a>, or directly assigned to the cell.
<P>
 
   Building a large window is done most efficiently by assigning the window
   elements and then calling <a href="../spicelib/wnvald.html">WNVALD</a>. Building up the window by repeated
   insertion requires repeated ordering operations; <a href="../spicelib/wnvald.html">WNVALD</a> does a single
   ordering operation.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Unary Routines"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Unary Routines
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Each unary routine operates on a single window. Six unary operations are
   supported, each of which alters the contents of the input window. The
   calling sequences are shown below.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../spicelib/wncond.html">WNCOND</a> ( LEFT, RIGHT, WINDOW )        { Contract }
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wnexpd.html">WNEXPD</a> ( LEFT, RIGHT, WINDOW )        { Expand }
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wnextd.html">WNEXTD</a> ( SIDE, WINDOW )               { Extract }
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wnfild.html">WNFILD</a> ( SMALL, WINDOW )              { Fill }
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wnfltd.html">WNFLTD</a> ( SMALL, WINDOW )              { Filter }
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wninsd.html">WNINSD</a> ( LEFT, RIGHT, WINDOW )        { Insert }
</PRE>
   Each of the unary window routines works in place. That is, only one
   window, WINDOW, appears in each calling sequence, serving as both input
   and output. Windows whose original contents need to be preserved should
   be copied prior to calling any of the unary routines.
<P>
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wninsd.html">WNINSD</a> inserts the interval whose endpoints are LEFT and RIGHT into
   WINDOW. If the input interval overlaps any of the intervals in the
   window, the intervals are merged. Thus, the cardinality of WINDOW can
   actually decrease as the result of an insertion.
<P>
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wnexpd.html">WNEXPD</a> and <a href="../spicelib/wncond.html">WNCOND</a> expand (lengthen) and contract (shorten) each of the
   intervals in WINDOW. The adjustments are not necessarily symmetric. That
   is, <a href="../spicelib/wnexpd.html">WNEXPD</a> works by subtracting LEFT units from the left endpoint of
   each interval and adding RIGHT units to the right endpoint of each
   interval. <a href="../spicelib/wncond.html">WNCOND</a> is the same as EXP with the signs of the arguments
   reversed, and is primarily provided for clarity in coding. (Expansion by
   negative increments is a messy concept.) Intervals are merged when
   expansion causes them to overlap. Intervals are dropped when they are
   contracted by amounts greater than their measures.
<P>
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wnfltd.html">WNFLTD</a> and <a href="../spicelib/wnfild.html">WNFILD</a> remove small intervals and small gaps between adjacent
   intervals. Both routines take as input a minimum measure, SMALL. <a href="../spicelib/wnfltd.html">WNFLTD</a>
   filters out (drops) intervals with measures less than or equal to SMALL,
   while <a href="../spicelib/wnfild.html">WNFILD</a> merges adjacent intervals separated by gaps with measures
   less than or equal to SMALL.
<P>
 
   Depending on the value of SIDE, <a href="../spicelib/wnextd.html">WNEXTD</a> extracts the left or right
   endpoints of each interval in WINDOW. The resulting window contains only
   the singleton intervals
<P>

   [ a(1), a(1) ], ..., [ a(n), a(n) ]

<A NAME="Binary Routines"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Binary Routines
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Binary routines operate on two input windows to produce a third
   (distinct) output window. Three major binary operations are supported.
   The calling sequences are shown below.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../spicelib/wnunid.html">WNUNID</a> ( A, B, C )           { Union }
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wnintd.html">WNINTD</a> ( A, B, C )           { Intersection }
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wndifd.html">WNDIFD</a> ( A, B, C )           { Difference }
</PRE>
   In contrast with the unary routines, none of the binary routines work in
   place. The output window, C, must be distinct from both of the input
   windows, A and B. We will have more to say about this later on.
<P>
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wnunid.html">WNUNID</a> places the union of A and B into C. The union of two windows
   contains every point that is contained in the first window, or in the
   second window, or in both windows.
<P>
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wnintd.html">WNINTD</a> places the intersection of A and B into C. The intersection of
   two windows contains every point that is contained in the first window
   AND in the second.
<P>
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wndifd.html">WNDIFD</a> places the difference of A and B into C. The difference of two
   windows contains every point that is contained in the first window, but
   NOT in the second.
<P>
 
   In each case, if the output window, C, is not large enough to hold the
   result of the operation, as many intervals as will fit are inserted into
   the window, and a SPICE error is signaled. (You can control the effect
   of this error on your program; refer to Error Required Reading.)
<P>
 
   In each of the binary routines, the output window must be distinct from
   both of the input windows. All three of the binary operations can, in
   principle, be performed in place, but not all can be performed
   efficiently. Consequently, for the sake of consistency, none of the
   routines work in place. For example, the following calls are invalid.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../spicelib/wnintd.html">WNINTD</a> ( A, B, A )
 
   <a href="../spicelib/wnintd.html">WNINTD</a> ( A, B, B )
 
</PRE>
   In each of the examples above, whether or not the subroutine signals an
   error, the results will almost certainly be wrong. Nearly the same
   effect can be achieved, however, by placing the result into a temporary
   window, which can be immediately copied back into one of the input
   windows, as shown below.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../spicelib/wnintd.html">WNINTD</a> ( A, B, TEMP )
 
   <a href="../spicelib/copyd.html">COPYD</a> ( TEMP, A )

<H2> Complement Routines
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   <a href="../spicelib/wncomd.html">WNCOMD</a> determines the complement of a window with respect to an
   interval. The calling sequence is
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../spicelib/wncomd.html">WNCOMD</a> ( LEFT, RIGHT, A, C )         { Complement }
</PRE>
   As with the binary routines, the output window, C, must be distinct from
   the input window, A.
<P>
 
   Mathematically, the complement of a window contains those points that
   are not contained in the window. That is, the complement of the set of
   closed intervals
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [ a(1), b(1) ], [ a(2), b(2) ], ..., [ a(n), b(n) ]
</PRE>
   is the set of open intervals
<P>
 
<PRE>
   ( -inf, a(1) ), ( b(1), a(2) ), ..., ( b(n), +inf )
</PRE>
   Not all computer languages offer a satisfactory way to represent
   infinity, so <a href="../spicelib/wncomd.html">WNCOMD</a> must take the complement with respect to a finite
   interval.
<P>
 
   Since the results of a window routine must be another window, <a href="../spicelib/wncomd.html">WNCOMD</a>
   returns the closure of the set theoretical complement. In short, the
   double precision complement of the window
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [ a(1), b(1) ], [ a(2), b(2) ], ..., [ a(n), b(n) ]
</PRE>
   with respect to the interval from LEFT to RIGHT is the intersection of
   the windows
<P>
 
<PRE>
   ( -inf, a(1) ], [ b(1), a(2) ], ..., [ b(n), +inf )
</PRE>
   and [ LEFT, RIGHT ].
<P>
 
   Intervals of measure zero (singleton intervals) in the original window
   are replaced by gaps of measure zero, which are filled. Thus,
   complementing a window twice does not necessarily yield the original
   window.

   Comparison routines allow the contents of windows to be compared against
   the contents of other windows. There are four comparison routines: three
