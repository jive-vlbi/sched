C
C$ Detailed_Input
C
C     HANDLE         is an EK file handle.  The file may be open for
C                    reading or writing.
C
C     SEGDSC         is the segment descriptor of the segment
C                    containing the column specified by COLDSC.
C
C     COLDSC         is the column descriptor of the column to be
C                    searched.
C
C     IKEY,
C     RECPTR         are, respectively, an integer key and a
C                    pointer to the EK record containing that key.
C                    The last column entry less than or equal to
C                    this key is sought.  The order relation used
C                    is dictionary ordering on the pair (IKEY, RECPTR).
C
C     NULL           is a logical flag indicating whether the input
C                    key is null.  When NULL is .TRUE., IKEY is
C                    ignored by this routine.
C
C$ Detailed_Output
C
C     PRVIDX         is the ordinal position, according to the order
C                    relation implied by the column's index, of the
C                    record containing the last element less than or
C                    equal to IKEY, where the order relation is
C                    as indicated above.  If the column contains
C                    elements equal to IKEY, PRVIDX is the index of the
C                    last such element.
C
C                    If all elements of the column are greater than
C                    IKEY, PRVIDX is set to zero.
C
C     PRVPTR         is a pointer to the record containing the element
C                    whose ordinal position is PRVIDX.
C
C                    If all elements of the column are greater than
C                    IKEY, PRVPTR is set to zero.
C
C$ Parameters
C
C     None.
C
C$ Exceptions
C
C     1)  If HANDLE is invalid, the error will be diagnosed by routines
C         called by this routine.
C
C     2)  If the data type of the input column is not integer,
C         the error SPICE(INVALIDTYPE) is signalled.
C
C     3)  If the input column is not indexed, the error
C         SPICE(NOTINDEXED) is signalled.
C
C     4)  If the index type of the input column is not recognized,
C         the error SPICE(INVALIDTYPE) is signalled.
C
C     5)  If an I/O error occurs while reading or writing the indicated
C         file, the error will be diagnosed by routines called by this
C         routine.

C
C$ Particulars
C
C     This routine finds the last column element less than or equal
C     to a specified integer key, within a specified segment and
C     column.  The order relation used is dictionary ordering on the
C     pair (IKEY, RECPTR).
C
C     In order to support the capability of creating an index for a
C     column that has already been populated with data, this routine
C     does not require that the number of elements referenced by the
C     input column's index match the pointer of elements in the column;
C     the index is allowed to reference fewer elements.  However,
C     every record referenced by the index must be populated with data.
