C
C      VARIABLE  I/O  DESCRIPTION
C      --------  ---  --------------------------------------------------
C      STRING     I   Input character string.
C      LASTPC     O   Index of the last printable character in STRING.
C
C$ Detailed_Input
C
C      STRING      is the input character string.
C
C$ Detailed_Output
C
C      LASTPC      is the index of the last printable character
C                  in the input string. Characters 33-126 are
C                  considered to be printable characters. Blanks
C                  are not considered printable characters. If
C                  the input string contains no printable characters,
C                  LASTPC is zero.
C
C$ Parameters
C
C      None.
C
C$ Particulars
C
C      This works exactly like LASTNB, except that it skips
C      non-printable characters (ASCII control characters) as
C      well as blanks.
C
C$ Examples
C
C      The program
C
C         INTEGER         FRSTNB
C         INTEGER         FRSTPC
C         INTEGER         LASTNB
C         INTEGER         LASTPC

C
C         S( 1: 1) = ' '
C         S( 2: 2) = CHAR (  2 )
C         S( 3: 3) = CHAR (  3 )
C         S( 4: 4) = 'A'
C         S( 5: 5) = 'B'
C         S( 6: 6) = 'C'
C         S( 7: 7) = CHAR (  7 )
C         S( 8: 8) = CHAR (  8 )
C         S( 9: 9) = CHAR (  9 )
C         S(10:10) = ' '
C
C         WRITE (*,*) 'Non-blank from ', FRSTNB(S), ' to ', LASTNB(S)
C         WRITE (*,*) 'Printable from ', FRSTPC(S), ' to ', LASTPC(S)
C
C         END
C
C      produces te following output:
C
C         Non-blank from 2 to 9.
C         Printable from 4 to 6.

C     Look for the last character in the range [33,126], and return
C     its index.
C
      DO I = LEN ( STRING ), 1, -1
 
         IF (       (ICHAR ( STRING(I:I) ) .GE.  33)

C
C     Still here? No printable characters. Return zero.
C
      LASTPC = 0
