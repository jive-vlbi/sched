C     --------  ---  --------------------------------------------------
C     ARRAY      I   Input array.
C     NELT       I   Number of elements.
C     DIR        I   Direction to cycle: 'F' or 'B'.
C     NCYCLE     I   Number of times to cycle.
C     OUT        O   Cycled array.
C
C$ Detailed_Input
C
C     ARRAY       is the array to be cycled.
C
C     NELT        is the number of elements in the input array.
C
C     DIR         is the direction in which the elements in the
C                 array are to be cycled.
C
C                    'F' or 'f'  to cycle forward.
C                    'B' or 'b'  to cycle backward.
C
C     NCYCLE      is the number of times the elements in the array
C                 are to be cycled.
C
C$ Detailed_Output
C
C     OUT         is the input array after it has been cycled.
C
C$ Parameters
C
C     None.
C
C$ Exceptions
C
C     1) If the value of DIR is not recognized, the error
C        SPICE(INVALIDDIRECTION) is signaled.
C
C     2) If NELT is less than 1, the output array is not modified.
C
C     3) If NCYCLE is negative, the array is cycled NCYCLE times in
C        the opposite direction of DIR.
C
C$ Files
C
C     None.
C
C$ Particulars
C
C     An array is cycled when its contents are shifted forward or
C     backward by one place. An element pushed off one end of the
C     array is brought around to the other end of the array instead
C     of disappearing.
C
C$ Examples
C
C     Let the integer array A contain the following elements.
C
C        A(1) = 1
C        A(2) = 2
C        A(3) = 3
C        A(4) = 4
C
C     Cycling A forward once yields the array
C
C        A(1) = 4
C        A(2) = 1
C        A(3) = 2
C        A(4) = 3
C
C     Cycling A backward once yields the array
C
C        A(1) = 2
C        A(2) = 3
C        A(3) = 4
C        A(4) = 1
C
C     Cycling by any multiple of the number of elements in the array
C     yields the same array.
C
C$ Restrictions
C
C     The memory used for the output array must be disjoint from the
C     memory used for the input array.

C-    SPICELIB Version 1.0.3, 18-MAY-2010 (BVS)
C
C        Removed "C$" marker from text in the header.

C
C        Header correction: assertions that the output
C        can overwrite the input have been removed.
C
C-    SPICELIB Version 1.0.1, 10-MAR-1992 (WLT)
C
C        Comment section for permuted index source lines was added
C        following the header.

C
C-     Beta Version 2.0.0, 16-JAN-1989 (HAN)
C
C         Error handling was added to detect an invalid value for
C         the cycling direction. If the direction is not recognized
C         the error SPICE(INVALIDDIRECTION) is signalled and the
C         output array is not modified. (The routine used to copy the
C         input array into the output array if the direction was not
C         recognized.)
C
C         The "Exceptions" section was filled out in more detail.

C
C     A backward cycle is the same as a forward cycle by the opposite
C     of NCYCLE.  Moreover a cycle by K is the same as a cycle by
C     K + m*N for any integer m.  Thus we compute the value of the
C     minimum forward right cycle that is equivalent to the inputs.

C     The algorithm used to cycle arrays is identical to the one used
C     to cycle character strings in CYCLEC. We won't repeat the (rather
C     lengthy) description here.
C
      G = GCD ( K, NELT )
      M = NELT / G
 
      DO I = 1, G
 
         L    = I
         LAST = ARRAY(L)
 
         DO J = 1, M
 
            L = L + K
 
            IF ( L .GT. NELT ) THEN
               L = L - NELT
            END IF
 
            TEMP    = ARRAY(L)
            OUT(L)  = LAST
            LAST    = TEMP
 
         END DO
 
      END DO
 
 
      CALL CHKOUT ( 'CYCLAI' )
      RETURN
      END
