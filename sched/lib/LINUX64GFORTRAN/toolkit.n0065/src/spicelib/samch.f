C$ Brief_I/O
C
C     VARIABLE  I/O  DESCRIPTION
C     --------  ---  --------------------------------------------------
C     STR1       I   A character string
C     L1         I   The location (index) of a character in STR1
C     STR2       I   A character string
C     L2         I   The location (index) of a character in STR2
C
C     The function returns TRUE if the two characters are the
C     same.
C
C$ Detailed_Input
C
C     STR1       is a character string
C
C     L1         is the location (index) of a character in STR1
C
C     STR2       is a character string
C
C     L2         is the location (index) of a character in STR2
C
C$ Detailed_Output
C
C
C     The function returns TRUE if the characters STR1(L1:L1) and
C     STR2(L2:L2) are the same.
C
C     If the characters are different or L1 or L2 is out of range the
C     function returns FALSE.
C
C$ Parameters
C
C      None.
C
C$ Files
C
C      None.
C
C$ Exceptions
C
C     Error free.
C
C     1) If either L1 or L2 is out of range the function returns FALSE.
C
C$ Particulars
C
C     This is a utility function for determining whether or not
C     two characters in different strings are the same.  This
C     function is intended for situation in which you need to
C     search two strings for a match (or mismatch).
C
C$ Examples
C
C     Often you need to scan through two string comparing character
C     by character until a mismatch occurs.  The usual way to code
C     this is
C
C        DO WHILE (        L1 .LE. LEN(STR1)
C                    .AND. L2 .LE. LEN(STR2)
C                    .AND. STR1(L1:L1) .EQ. STR2(L2:L2) )
C
C           L1 = L1 + 1
C           L2 = L2 + 1
C
C        END DO
C
C        Check L1, L2 to make sure we are still in range, etc.
C
C     The problem with this loop is that even though the check to make
C     sure that L1 and L2 are in range is performed, FORTRAN may
C     go ahead and compute the equality condition even though one of the
C     first two steps failed.  This can lead to out of range errors
C     and possible halting of your program depending upon how
C     the routine is compiled.   An alternative way to code this is
C
C        IF ( L1 .LE. LEN(STR1) .AND. L2 .LE. LEN(STR2) ) THEN
C           ALIKE = STR1(L1:L1) .EQ. STR2(L2:L2)
C        ELSE
C           ALIKE = .FALSE.
C        END IF
C
C        DO WHILE ( ALIKE )
C
C           L1 = L1 + 1
C           L2 = L2 + 1
C
C           IF ( L1 .LE. LEN(STR1) .AND. L2 .LE. LEN(STR2) ) THEN
C              ALIKE = STR1(L1:L1) .EQ. STR2(L2:L2)
C           ELSE
C              ALIKE = .FALSE.
C           END IF
C        END DO
C
C     However this is a much more complicated section of code.  This
C     routine allows you to code the above loops as:
C
C
C        DO WHILE ( SAMCH ( STR1,L1, STR2,L2 )  )
C           L1 = L1 + 1
C           L2 = L2 + 1
C        END DO
C
C     The boundary checks are automatically performed and out
C     of range errors are avoided.
