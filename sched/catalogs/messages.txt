                   SCHED MESSAGE FILE

This file contains messages that SCHED may wish to write to the
log file if something needs explanation.  Each message is preceeded
by a line starting with ++ and giving the message name.  A line 
starting with -- is not passed by SCHED to the log file.  It is
useful to record which subroutine requests the message.  The routine
WRTMSG reads this file and writes the message.

++eqep
--Called by SRREAD

You have used both EQUINOX and EPOCH in your source lists to set the
EQUINOX for precession.  EPOCH used to be used for this purpose, but
that is not really correct as became apparent when stellar proper
motions were introduced.  EQUINOX is now the proper veriable to use
for the purpose and the valid arguments are 'J2000', 'B1950', and
'DATE'.  SCHED tolerates the use of EPOCH for this purpose for 
backwards compatibility.  But if both are used, SCHED does not know
which to believe.  This can happen when you have some sources in a
SRCCAT section in the keyin input file and still use EPOCH while the
main source catalogs distributed with SCHED use EQUINOX.  Please
convert all source lists you are using to EQUINOX.

++expcode
--Called by CHKCODE

======================================================================
  WARNING   The project code (EXPCODE) for this observation has a 
            non-standard format.  Valid codes start with one or two 
            letters followed by 3 digits.  Any leading zeros should 
            be included.  A couple of valid examples are bt068 
            and v003.

            Note that some SCHED examples use non-valid codes, as do
            VLBA test observations.

++vlaflukephase
--Called by CHKVLA

======================================================================
  WARNING   The Fluke synthesizers at the VLA (pre EVLA) are used to 
            fine tune the VLA frequency.  They have the property that
            they do not necessarily return to the same phase if the
            frequency is set to something other than a multiple of
            10 MHz.  This is ok for the VLA because all antennas use
            the same Fluke signals.  But it will spoil phase coherence
            between scans for frequency switched VLBI (or EVLA) 
            observations.

            This schedule has setups with different VLA Fluke settings
            and at least one is not a multiple of 10 MHz.  Therefore
            you are at risk of random phase changes between scans for
            the VLA.  This may or may not be a problem depending on 
            the nature of the observations.  If you don't plan to carry
            phase between scans separated by scans at other frequencies,
            then there should not be a problem.  If you are doing some
            sort of combined frequency switching and phase referencing,
            then it won't work.

++freqcatwarning
--Called by SETFCAT

  There is inadequate information to specify a setup without
  information from the frequency catalog.
  If there is a frequency catalog entry for what you want, the
  setup file must contain at least:
  STATION, FREQREF, POL, BBFILTER, BITS, and NCHAN.
  If there is no appropriate entry in the catalog, you will 
  need more.    See the manual.' )

++freqnomatch
--Called by SETFCAT

                    -----------  WARNING  -----------
SCHED could not find a frequency catalog group that matched the setup file
and station mentioned above.  Below are the closest matches with at least 
some overlap in RF frequency.  You can use FREQLIST (a main program input) 
to get the frequency catalog group and IF numbers that are available.  Or
you can look in freq.dat in the catalogs area.

Since SCHED cannot confirm the validity of your setup, check and be very 
sure it is correct!

In the table below, a match is indicated by a T.  A mismatch is indicated by F.

++goofyepoch
--Called by SRREAD

You have specified an EPOCH that is unlikely to be correct.  It
cannot be interpreted as what used to be called EPOCH but is
now EQUINOX (valid options are J2000, B1950, and DATE) and it
is not a date between 1900 and 2100.  It is likely that you
specified something like J1991.25 as may be apparent from the
character form shown above.  Sched will proceed using what you
specified as the reference date for proper motions, but it is
very likely that this is not what you really want.

++modtst
--Called by OKMODES

                -------------  WARNING  ---------------
You have specified MODETEST in a setup file.  This makes it possible
to record observations that cannot be correlated.  Please do not use
this parameter unless you absolutely have to.  If you do, it is best
to communicate with correlator support personnel to be sure that the
data will be usable.


++noassignbbc
--Called by BBCALT

BBCALT could not assign a BBC to channel ICHAN (see above) in the
setup file given above.  The allowed IF channels from the frequency
catalog are given above as IFNAME and alternate ALTIFC.  The number of
BBCs assumed to be available at station is given above as NNBBC
The setup information already available will be shown below.

++oldspeed
--Called from RDSET.

You have specified the tape speed using the setup file parameter
TPSPEED.  This is an obsolete way of specifying this parameter.
You should use TPSPEEDH and TPSPEEDL here in the setup file, or 
better yet, let SCHED use its defaults, which are good for almost
all circumstances.

++padloss
--Called from CHKSOC.

CHKSOC: *** WARNING ***  You have requested a fanout of 4 and
        the ZEROPAD correlator weighting function.  That will 
        cause half the data not to be used (cannot overlap the FFTs).
        The automatic setting of FORMAT does not understand this.  
        You may need to force FORMAT in the setup.

++plstainstructions
--Called by PLOTSTA
   Left click on station to toggle station plotting.
   Middle click or type M on station to mark to move. 
      Then left click new position
   Right click to finish plots.
   Type O to run an optimization.
   Type G to toggle plotting of optimization grid.
   Type S to get a contour plot of quality around first red station.
   Type Z to zoom in, z to zoom out - centered at cursor.
   Type p for a bw postscript version of the map.
   Type P for a color postscript version of the map.
   Type K for SKA specific postscript files.

++polerr
--Called from CHKSOC.

CHKSOC:  Track assignments were specified that cannot be polarization 
         processed in Socorro. It is safest to assign polarization
         pairs to adjacent channels.  Try that, let SCHED make the
         track assignments, or contact an expert for help.

++rollerr
--Called from CHKSOC.

CHKSOC:  Channels to be processed in Socorro as a polarization pair
         must be assigned to the same roll group when barrel rolling 
         is on. It is safest to assign polarization pairs to adjacent 
         channels.

++scanremoval
--Called from AUTODOWN

  * Stations using automatic tape allocation or disk recording systems
    are being removed from scans when the source is below the antenna 
    pointing limits.  This behavior can be overridden using DODOWN.

++taperunning
--Called from SETTPS

  Tape is being kept running through short gaps between scans.
Add TPSTART to the SUMITEM list to see details.
MINPAUSE and PRESTART may be used to adjust.
Remember MINPAUSE is multiplied by the speed up factor.

++vlaover24
--Called from CHKVLA

This schedule is over 24 hours and contains the VLA.  That is not
wise.  VLA telescope files do not have a day associated with each
scan, so, if there is a restart after the first 24 hours are up,
observing may resume on the wrong (previous day's) scan.
   
++VXDISK
--Called from VXWRT (obsolete)

                    -----------  WARNING  -----------
You have specified DISK in the TAPEINI section for one or more stations. This
VEX file can not be processed at the current time (2004 Jan 7). You must
schedule for tapes to produce a valid VEX file. For testing purposes *ONLY*,
parameter VEXTEST may be specified in the key file. Observations not requiring
a VEX file (e.g. VLBA correlated in Socorro) should *not* specify parameter
DOVEX in the key file.

++astropatch
--Called from CHK4DAR

The frequency setup you have specified is not allowed for a MkIV station.
Astronomical patching at MkIV stations is restricted such that odd numbered
BBCs can only receive signal from IF channels 1N and 2A, and even numbered BBCs
receive signal from IF channels 2N and 1A (also every setup must use at least
one of either 1N or 2N). Probably you have specified an 'IFCHAN', or you have
specified a 'BBC' and 'POL' combination that is incompatible with this. Try
using SCHED defaults instead of explicit setting of 'IFCHAN' or 'BBC'.


++slowdatarate
--Called from CHK4REC
--Called from CHKJIVE

You have requested a track bit rate below 4 Mb/s/track. This is not permitted
for recordings going to the EVN correlator at JIVE. If this experiment is going
to JIVE you can increase the track bit rate by either increasing the total data
rate or decreasing the fanout of the recording.

++barrelroll
--Called from CHKJIVE

You have requested barrel rolling. This is not possible for the JIVE correlator
at the current time. It is allowed for experiments to be correlated in Socorro
or Bonn. Testers *only* may specify MODETEST.

++ftpgap
--Called from VXSCH

You have requested an ftp (GRAB) scan. In order to copy the data from the Mk5A
disk to the system disk you must leave a gap before the next scan so that this
can be done before the next scan begins. The minimum safe gap, based on the
amount of data you have requested to transfer, is given in the messages above.

++oversamp
--Called from CHKJIVE
One or more of the channels in one or more of your setups uses oversampling.
Experiments going to the EVN correlator at JIVE may use a maximum oversampling
factor of 4. Higher oversampling factors cannot be correlated.
