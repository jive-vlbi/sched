Instructions for making a release of SCHED

Before a release:

1.  Get the latest versions of the Vex and plot code from 
    Cormac and Franco.

2.  Make sure VERSION and VERNUM in versched.f are up to date.
    Make sure the version on the manual first page are current.

    Set the NEWVER in the window where this work is being done so
    that script segments below can be used with a cut-and-paste
    Also check a couple of places below (other machines) where the
    version number is also needed.

setenv NEWVER 6.01

3.  Compile and link SCHED on the development machine.
    Afterwards leave the link "Makefile" pointing to "Makefile.linux".
    That is what we want in the distribution, but we want the local
    version linked with the spice package.  
    Do not use the form "make -f Makefile.linux.spice".  During 
    execution of make, make is again invoked without -f and you 
    will get whatever "Makefile" points to for the final link.

/bin/rm Makefile
ln -s Makefile.linux.spice Makefile
make
/bin/rm Makefile
ln -s Makefile.linux Makefile

4.  Update the manual and the web version:

5.  Write a release note.  This will be mainly a link to the manual
    update section.

6.  Check the README and README.ftp files in $SCHED.



Prepare the manual:

1.  Update the examples embedded in the manual.  You can use the 
    following lines as a script.

cd $SCHED/doc
/bin/rm sched.tex.tmp
mv sched.tex sched.tex.tmp
inserttex 
sched.tex.tmp
sched.tex
 
2.  Process the manual.  latex will probably need to be run up to
    3 times to get all the links right.
    The local icons switch keeps users from having to go to
    NRAO for the up etc buttons.
    The -link option controls how deep the automatic contents pages
    go at each level.  Without it, the contents on the top level
    page are long enought to frighten off users.

latex sched.tex
latex2html -local_icons -link 2 sched.tex



Update the setup files:

cd $SCHED/setups
makesetup



Update the catalogs from the masters.

cd $SCHED/catalogs
Update

    Then hand update the VERSIONs in the source, stations, and 
    locations files 



Update the examples and clean up the area.
   Check that testruns.out shows a clean comparison after Verify.

cd $SCHED/examples
Verify
Newstd
schclean "*"



Test the plot functions on egplan.key.  Verify does not make plots.
    Do this at some point on a different machine (like a Sun).
    For 2002Jul02, there was a bug in plotxy and plotuv that 
    only showed up on a Sun.



Make the tar files.

1.  First, move any files from TARFILES that should be archived to 
    $SCHED/ARCHIVE.

2.  Run "package" and "package2" for the current version using the
    lines below.
      The use of "source" seems to be needed on the Mac to get the 
      right SCHED environment variable.

package {$NEWVER}
source ./package2 Linux {$NEWVER}





Test the release.

   Unpack the source distribution into /users/cwalker/sched_test and
   test the compilation without the satellite stuff (clean out 
   sched_test first if needed).
   Use the makefile that does not use the spice package
   Check testruns.out at the end.

cd /users/cwalker/sched_test
chmod u+w /users/cwalker/sched_test/catalogs/*
/bin/rm -r *

#  Copy documentation to the web server master files on the mach disk
#  My cron jobs will move them to the main web server or run 
#  /home/eolus/cwalker/backups/rsync_mach_cwalker afterwards.
#  Careful with the big delete (rm) below (that's why the cd ~ first)
#  The initial removal of the catalogs etc directories is because the
#  cp -r copied too much into those places.
