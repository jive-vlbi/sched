!  BE001 example of 3C84 observations at 6 and 4 cm.
!
!    This example shows many things in gory detail and has
!    many comments.  The example manual_2.key used to be the 
!    exact same schedule, but takes advantage of SCHED defaults
!    and is missing most comments.  It looks much less 
!    intimidating and is closer to what users will actually 
!    make.
!
!    Manual_1.key was changed from legacy recording system 
!    to the wide band RDBE and WIDAR systems with the DDC 
!    personality on Nov. 1, 2012  RCW.  For now, it differs
!    from Manual_2.key which is still for the legacy system
!    and has had the GBT swapped for the VLA which cannot
!    do legacy style observations.

!  Now specify the setup information.  These are adapted from
!  the ones in example vladdc.key.  They use 4 channels of 128 MHz
!  bandwidth each for 2 Gbps total bit rate.
!  The second is 4 cm.
!  The second setup defaults more parameters than the first and 
!  shows all that a user is really required to provide if the desired
!  frequency is included in the frequency catalog.

!  Note, here is where VLA1 and VLA27 are different - they have
!  different rchan and lchan.  To avoid errors, do not use a 
!  generic "VLA".  The switch to the WIDAR correlator will cause
!  most VLA information to change in the future.

!  Sched will look for matching sets in the frequency file, but 
!  that defaults to freq.dat - the one for the legacy system.

 !  Start with a fringe finder on all antennas at both frequencies.

 !  of a gap between the scans for the antennas to get to the source.
 !  The VLA will be in single dish mode 'VS' for the whole project.

 !  with dwell scheduling is demonstrated
