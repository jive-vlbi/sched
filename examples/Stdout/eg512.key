!  Start with 256 Mbps to be sure that the slower rate
!  in an observation that contains 512 Mbps works correctly.
!  In this circumstance, both drives should be used, but
    !  Long time for postpasses and tape change.
!  at 8 Mbps/track.

!  Information note:
!  This file produced an example of the kind of weird and 
!  wonderful things that can happen with tape handling.
!  In the eg512-256 mode, there are two scans of 22 min each
!  in each pass.  Without a slew, the gap is 10 seconds set
!  by MINSETUP for GBT_VLBA.  That is long enough that the
!  tape would not stop between scans.  But when there were
!  7 scans on 3C454.3, the long slew to 3C84 happened in
!  the middle of a tape in a reverse pass.  Thus the tape
!  after the next scan was positioned 10 seconds in from the
!  start.  When the second scan of that pass, which also 
!  needed an extra 10 seconds, it looked like it would go
!  too far beyond the end of tape (there is a tolerance, but
!  it was exceeded).  Therefore, the tape reversed after
!  one scan.  This pattern kept up for a while, wasting half
!  of many tracks and requiring a premature tape change.
!  Here I have fixed the problem by causing the slew to 
!  happen at the tape end.  Other correction schemes could
!  be done by adjusting the scan lengths down a bit or by
!  changing MINPAUSE or PRESTART.
