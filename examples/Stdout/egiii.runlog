    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:   6.0  Release: March 2005

The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog

Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

TPINI:   Reading tape initialization information from SCHED input file.
SRREAD:  Reading source catalog: Program_input
STREAD:  Reading station catalog: /home/cwalker/mach/mach/cwalker/code/sched/catalogs/stations.dat
STREAD:  Will read locations file /home/cwalker/mach/mach/cwalker/code/sched/catalogs/locations.dat
SCHIN:   Found    56 input scans.
SRREAD:  Reading source catalog: /home/cwalker/mach/mach/cwalker/code/sched/catalogs/sources.vlba

GETFREQ: Reading frequency file: /home/cwalker/mach/mach/cwalker/code/sched/catalogs/freq.dat

CHKSC1: *** Shouldn't you be usingAUTOTAPE=2 (VLBA stations, VLBA correlator).
SCHOPT:  First output scan will be number     1
SCHOPT:  There will be    56 output scans (    1 -    56) from 282/13:03:30 to 282/23:50:00
