    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:   7.00  Development late 2006

The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog

Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

SRREAD:  Reading source catalog: Program_input
RDSET:   Reading setup file: bd27.set
RDSET:   Reading setup file: bd27a.set
STREAD:  Reading station catalog: /users/cwalker/files/sched_work/catalogs/stations.dat
STREAD:  Will read locations file /users/cwalker/files/sched_work/catalogs/locations.dat
SCHIN:   Found    23 input scans.
TPINI:   Using default tape initialization information.
GETFREQ: Reading frequency file: /users/cwalker/files/sched_work/catalogs/freq.dat

CHKSC1: *** Shouldn't you be using AUTOTAPE=2 (VLBA stations, VLBA correlator).
SCHOPT:  First output scan will be number     1

WRTMSG: Special message from routine AUTODOWN:

  * Stations using automatic tape allocation or disk recording systems
    are being removed from scans when the source is below the antenna
    pointing limits.  This behavior can be overridden using DODOWN.

SCHOPT:  There will be    23 output scans (    1 -    23) from 363/18:02:00 to 363/22:59:00
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file bd027.sum
OMSOUT:  Writing OMS file bd027.oms
FLAGS:   Writing apriori flagging file bd027.flag
