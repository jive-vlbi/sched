    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:   6.05  June 2006

The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog

Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).
