!  SAMPLE SCHED INPUT FOR VLA SPECIFIC EXPERIMENT PLANNING
!  
!  This file is a close cousin to egplan.key with the main difference
!  being in the station list.  It is used to determine when sources
!  are up, plot UV coverage, help find calibrators etc.

!  This file shows how to use SCHED to determine times when sources
!  are available, possible uv coverage, sky distribution etc.
!
!  OPTMODE=UPTIME is used to generate a psuedo schedule in which
!  each source has a day long string of scans, all on the same
!  day.  The summary file and the plotting capabilities can then 
!  be used to obtain the desired planning information.
!  Note, SCHED will not make telescope control files when
!  OPTMODE=UPTIME because the time order of scans is not enforced.
!
!  Start SCHED interactively and specify the line (without the !):
!   plot  schedule=planvla.key  /
