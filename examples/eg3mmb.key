!  Second example sched input file for VLBA observations at 3mm.

!  The main difference from other 3mm examples is the use of automatic
!  generation of the reference pointing scans using information from
!  the external file peak.cmd.

!  Original 2000aug08 Craig Walker and Vivek Dhawan
!  Modified 10oct2000 RCW for better reference pointing.
!  Modified 21nov2000 RCW. Convert to autopeak.

! This example observes AHSco (SiO maser) in the same mode as

! The reference pointing insertion will use the 7mm SiO masers
! P-AHSco and others that are in sources.pointing.

!  Start with two scans on 3C273.
!  The first is for pointing.  Rather than have SCHED insert
!  this scan, the use of POINT to make a scan a pointing scan
!  is demonstrated.  With no argument, all stations, regardless
!  of pointing group, are included.  POINT will actually 
!  cause the pointing to be done at 7mm.  The second scan 
!  records data for fringe finding at 3mm.
