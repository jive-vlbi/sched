!  Second example sched input file for VLBA observations at 3mm.
!  This one uses 2 Gbps with the RDBE_DDC and 8 channels.

!  The main difference from other 3mm examples is the use of automatic
!  generation of the reference pointing scans using information from
!  the external file peak.cmd.

!  Original 2000aug08 Craig Walker and Vivek Dhawan
!  Modified 10oct2000 RCW for better reference pointing.
!  Modified 21nov2000 RCW. Convert to autopeak.
!  Modified Mar. 24, 2014 for RDBE  RCW.

!  The bit rate is 2 Gbps using 8 channels of the RDBE DDC.
!  Place 6 channels in the central 256 MHz of the IF and two
!  (one polarization) pair in the upper polyphase filter 
!  region.  There will be a gap around the 896 MHz crossover.

!  this scan, the use of POINT to make a scan a pointing scan
!  is demonstrated.  With no argument, all stations, regardless
!  of pointing group, are included.  POINT will actually 
!  cause the pointing to be done at 7mm.  The second scan 
!  records data for fringe finding at 3mm.

!  Now do 5 cycles of 2 scans each on SgrA, allowing SCHED 
!  to insert pointing before every other scan.
!  The insertion of the pointing scan(s) is triggered by the
!  presence of a sufficient gap between scans (based on the
