!  Sched example for testing the new VLBA synthesizers.

!  Pretty much a direct copy of the file for a synthesizer test 
!  Aug 13, 2013.   That was adapted from tl002a.key and tl002c from July.

!  This file was run as tl003
!  Note that LA was the only station with a new synthesizer, so will
!  be the only one with the odd frequencies.

!   Header comments from tl003:
!  Start with the dual synthesizer tests
!  These went ok in tl002c, but collect more data for stability testing.
!  Get some long scans.

!    2 IF C band.  Avoid spikes - standard bands.
!             LOs 4100 (4612-5124) and 5900 (6412-6924)
!    2 IF C band with known likely LO in IF issue.
!             LOs 3600 (4112-4624) and 7900 (6876-7388)
!             Expect spike at 7200
!    S/X
!    S/X with wide X - uses all 3.

!    Do some fast switching between the two C band cases to see in detail
!    what happens at the start - when things are settled, without having
!    to wait for pointing or subreflector.


!  Then do the targeted tests.  Expecially do the one with a fractional
!  MHz setting as that failed in tl002a.

!      Targeted fringe test.  Use 2cm for most sensitive to noise.
!      Use different DDC tuning so can test offsets not possible 
!         at other antennas.
!      Change inactive output over full range while keeping active one
!         constant to look for changes.  This was done in tl002a but
!         I have not yet located the correlated results and they could
!         have been lost.

!  A 2cm file with the ddc with 4 channels of 16 MHz.  All
!  stations tuned the same way with a 0.25 MHz offset for pcal.

!  Set tuning to non-even MHz.  But since the DDC doesn't necessarily
!  like frequencies other than multiple of 0.25, use one of those.
!  The LA setup doesn't match a freq.dat entry so specify everything.
!  The checking for the legacy system is going to get in our way.
!  When I set the new synthesizer to a fractional MHz, the pcalx
!  frequencies are declared bad by cksched.  So try 2 files, one
!  with the pcal off and a fractional setting.  The other with an
!  even MHz setting, but just not 500+-100 MHz.  Sched already rounds
!  of the synth setting for the legacy system to something that won't
!  abort.  

!  Fractional MHz offset.
