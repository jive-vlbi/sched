!   The DDC personality in the RDBE allows far more tuning 
!   flexibility then the PFB personality.  But there are 
!   restrictions on the actual frequencies that can be chosen.
!
!   
!   The first processing step breaks the 512 MHz wide IF (512 
!   to 1024 MHz) into three blocks (512-640, 640-896, and 
!   896-1024 MHz).  From there, frequency shifting and filtering 
!   happens within one of those blocks.  We call the boundaries 
!   between the blocks crossover freqencies. They are fixed and 
!   a single output baseband channel cannot get good data from 
!   both sides of one.  SCHED will warn of attempts to do so.
!
!   The DDC can set frequencies that are multiples of 1024 MHz (the 
!   sample rate) divided by powers of 2.  The finest setting is 
!   0.0596046 Hz.  But any frequency that does not have an integer 
!   number of cycles in one second can cause big problems with 
!   carrying phase over various events like frequency switches.  
!   So the settings must be limited to multiples of 15.625 kHz - 
!   the smallest setting that has an integer number of cycles in a 
!   second.  Such frequencies can be described as N*125 kHz + 0, 
!   15.625, 31.250, 46.875, 62.500, 78.125, 93.750, or 109.375 kHz.
!   Sched will not accept settings that are not multiples of 
!   15.625 kHz.  

!   Sched will also warn of settings that are not multiples of 250 
!   kHz which is the smallest value that is an even multiple of
!   10 kHz.  It is wise to stick to multiples of 250 kHz to assure
!   that there are no single precision variables that overflow 
!   somewhere in the processing chain (SCHED is ok - all double
!   precision for frequencies).

!   Note that any crd files (old system) written for some of these 
!   DDC frequency settings will have BBC frequencies rounded to the 
!   nearest 10 kHz as required by the old BBC hardware.
