Any text can be written here.  It will be written to the
summary file and the operator schedules.  This would be a good
place to put complicated instructions that cannot fit in the
notes above.  This is mainly useful for stations where some 
items have to be controlled by hand (pcal, tsys measurements,
special frequencies or wiring etc).  For the fully automated stations
like the VLBA, the operators don't tend to read any such notes.
