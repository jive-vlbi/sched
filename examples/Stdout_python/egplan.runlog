 
    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:  11.50
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

     No address specified.
     No PI phone number specified.
     No email address or fax number specified.
GETCOV:  Cover information incomplete or missing.
SRREAD:  Reading source catalog:  /home/eldering/sched/catalogs/sources.gsfc
INPUT:   Found     4 input scans.
SCHOPT:  First output scan will be number 5
OPTUPT:  OPTMODE=UPTIME was specified.  Station files (sch, crd,
         vex, and drudg) will not be written.
         There are 4 input scans with sources:
         1: 3C84
         2: DA193
         3: 3C120
         4: 3C273
SCHOPT:  There will be 384 output scans (5 - 388) from 344/00:00:00 to 344/24:00:00
CHKSCN:   336 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file egplan.sum
STALST:  WARNING - A station has zero axis offset, which is unlikely.
         Accurate positions, including axis offsets are needed for correlation.
         Is your station location information adequate?
         See the summary file station list to see which stations are suspect.
