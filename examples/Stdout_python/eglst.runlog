 
    Welcome to pySCHED version 1.12.0 based on
    SCHED version: 11.6 Release 11.6; Feburary 2020
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
pySCHED will use the catalogs under /export/jive/eldering/.pysched unless $SCHED is set.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Check 'sched.py -h' for command line paramters.
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

GLSTDAY: CAUTION:  You have specified a UT start day for an LST schedule.
    Unless this is for dynamic scheduling, please check scan dates carefully.

INPUT:   Found   305 input scans.
SHORTN: WARNING - Source names longer than 8 characters used.
        This will be a problem if geodetic software (SOLV etc) is used.
        This might be a problem on some correlators.
 
WRTMSG: Special message from routine CHKVDIFX:
 
You have allowed the DiFX software correlator to adjust your average
time to be an integral number of input FFT intervals (and an integral
number of short-term accumulator intervals).  You did this by
specifying CORAVG without a second argument set to "EXACT".  What you
did is the default, and recommended, option.  The adjustment will be a
few percent or less in most cases, although it can get as high as
sqrt(2) for an extreme narrow bandwidth case with a large number of
spectral channels.
 
SCHOPT:  First output scan will be number 1
 
WRTMSG: Special message from routine AUTODOWN:
 
  * Stations using automatic tape allocation or disk recording systems
    are being removed from scans when the source is below the antenna
    pointing limits.  This behavior can be overridden using DODOWN.
 
SCHOPT:  There will be 305 output scans (1 - 305) from 110/09:50:18 to 110/19:42:30

WRTMSG: Special message from routine VLBASU:
 
VLBASU: For stations using the RDBE, but also having old VLBA style
control systems (eg VLBA), crd files will be generated that may have
reduced channels and adjusted samplerate, frequencies and bandwidths
to conform to the capabilities of the old system.  These only affect
the old backend and recorder, not the new hardware.  They only affect
observations in that they will be used for reference pointing until
the new control system can point the antenna.  Also the system
temperatures and pulse cal information will be useful for monitoring
system health.  Note that, until Sept. 20, 2012, SCHED also set the
format to 'none', but it was then realized that this was not allowing
the formatter to be configured which prevented the pulse cal
detectors, which are in the formatter, from being set up properly.
