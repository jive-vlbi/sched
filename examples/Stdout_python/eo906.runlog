 
    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:  11.50
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

SHORTN: WARNING - Source names longer than 8 characters used.
        This will be a problem if geodetic software (SOLV etc) is used.
        This might be a problem on some correlators.
SCHOPT:  First output scan will be number     1
 
WRTMSG: Special message from routine AUTODOWN:
 
  * Stations using automatic tape allocation or disk recording systems
    are being removed from scans when the source is below the antenna
    pointing limits.  This behavior can be overridden using DODOWN.
 
SCHOPT:  There will be   112 output scans (    1 -   112) from 359/00:15:00 to 359/11:07:00
DOPFQ: *** Frequencies of channels set by DOPPLER overlap more than 20%.
           Was that intentional?
CHKSCN:    94 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file eo906.sum
STALST:  WARNING - A station has zero axis offset, which is unlikely.
         Accurate positions, including axis offsets are needed for correlation.
         Is your station location information adequate?
         See the summary file station list to see which stations are suspect.

WARNING, Phase cal not under computer control for some stations.
Contact stations by e-mail to make sure phase cal is switched off.
Phase cal is under computer control for VLBA stations and many others.
JODRELL1 has   18 Tsys measurements. Maximum interval =   44 minutes.
WSTRBORK has   18 Tsys measurements. Maximum interval =   44 minutes.
MEDICINA has   18 Tsys measurements. Maximum interval =   44 minutes.
NOTO     has   18 Tsys measurements. Maximum interval =   44 minutes.
ONSALA85 has   18 Tsys measurements. Maximum interval =   44 minutes.
TORUN    has   18 Tsys measurements. Maximum interval =   44 minutes.
URUMQI   has   13 Tsys measurements. Maximum interval =   44 minutes.
Tsys calibration at most MkIV stations is taken during every gap in recording,
but these appear over 15 min apart for the stations listed above!
This can be improved by inserting gaps at regular intervals.
Note this is not an issue for Westerbork or Arecibo.
 
WRTMSG: Special message from routine VXSCH:
For most MkIV stations (e.g. most of the EVN) the calibration diode is
only fired during gaps in recording. Although the total power is
monitored continuously during scans, the calibration diode must be
fired regularly to allow these total power levels to be accurately
converted to system temperatures. It is recommended that, where
possible, you leave a gap in recording at least every 15 minutes to
allow the system temperature measurements. The gap should be at least
15 seconds, but you should also try to ensure that these gaps are long
enough that all the antennas are on source before the next scan
starts. Note that warnings about Westerbork and Arecibo can be safely
ignored because they have continuous system temperature measurements.
 
JODRELL1: only   16 out of   18 Tsys measurements are on-source
Stations listed above are affected by slewing during Tsys calibration
 
WRTMSG: Special message from routine VXSCH:
Note that although you may have left gaps during which the system temperature
can be measured at MkIV stations, one or more stations are still slewing at the
scan starts. System temperatures measured when the antennas are slewing are
unlikely to be useful. The time between useful Tsys measurements is therefore
likely to be longer than the recommended 15 minutes at the stations listed
above. Note that warnings about Westerbork and Arecibo can be safely ignored.
