!   Example schedule for VLBA and Mark IV observations
!   with 512 Mbps recorded bit rate.  This used to be a demonstration
!   of the use of 2 tape drives on the VLBA and 2 heads on MKIV.
!   It now uses disk systems, including the RDBE_DDC on the VLBA.
!
!   Created originally for testing purposes: H.J. van Langevelde
!   Adapted as a SCHED example: R.C. Walker  28 Dec 2000.
!   RDBE conversion  March 27, 2014.  RCW.
!
!   For testing purposes, there are a couple of lines that 
!   can be swapped to trigger postpass related warnings: look for 
!   !go_warn or !go_ok
!
!   Change name of 3C48 to J0137+3309.  sources.petrov does not have
!   the 3C48 alternate name.

!  Leave the readback and tape change options, but they

!  Put in a gap of 16 seconds once per cycle through the loop
!  to keep the field stations happy with pack change opportunities.
