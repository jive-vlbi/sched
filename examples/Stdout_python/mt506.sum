  Notes:    VLBA Monitoring test in dynamic scheduling
            and runs for 90 minutes (1.5 hours) total.
            Note: MAKE SURE ONE SOURCE IS SELECTED
   


COVER LETTER:

 Please schedule ONE source depending on between approximately -3h to +3h of LST in Pie Town;
 a source can be selected by deleting the -one and only- ONE explanation mark in front of it.
 
 
ALLOWED PREEMPTION TIMES
 
 Dynamically scheduled VLBA projects can have optional scans at                 
 the start and end designated by PREEMPT='EXTRA'.  These can be                 
 used or not used to help with efficient meshing with previous                  
 and following projects.  Only the core time range will be used                 
 for the initial dynamic project selection.  DOSCANScan be used to              
 restrict the scan range sent to the .vex, .oms, crd., sch., and                
 .flag files.                                                                   
 
 The schedule can also designate which scans can be preempted at                
 PT and MK for daily USNO EOP observations using PREEMPT='OK'                   
 or 'NO'.  For details, see the manual discussion of PREEMPT.                   
 
 Time ranges available for USNO daily EOP observations at PT and MK:            
  1    (041) 21:48:13  to  (041) 23:17:58
 
 Project times summary:                                                         
 Core start and stop:         (041) 21:48:13  to  (041) 23:17:58

DERIVED INFORMATION FOR CORRELATION: 
                                                All scans
  Elapsed time for project (hours):                 1.50
  Total time in scheduled scans (hours):            1.21
  Total time in recording scans (hours):            1.21
  Total baseline hours (recording scans):          66.73
  Projected max correlator output rate (kB/s):     245.5
  Projected correlator output data size (MB):     1024.8
 NOTES:  Above numbers assume the same correlator parameters are used for all data.
         The 'baseline hours' include the autocorrelations (for data size calculations).
         The correlator output data rate is for real-time processing.
         Above numbers assume the same correlator parameters are used for all data.
         The recordings for a scan are assumed to start at the scan START minus PRESTART.
         Some stations (VLA, VLBA/MARK5C) wait for good data so the estimates may be high.

  Notes on the station scan summaries: 

    "Record Scans" are periods of recording with no gap.  The Mark5A disk systems 
    have a limit of 1024 such scans.  There are often multiple projects on a disk pack.
    If using MARK5A, try to keep above about 6 GB per record scan by using MINPAUSE 
    and PRESTART to prevent short gaps.  However, also try to prevent record scans 
    of more than an hour to minimize risk to data from playback problems.
    MARK5C will have one observe scan per record scan and there is no limit to the number.

    "Sync Hours" is on-source, in-scan time lost during correlation to resyncing
    recordings.  Resyncs follow tape stoppages and formatter reconfigures.

    For VLBA DAR stations, total reconfigures and reconfigures during recording are shown.
    Reconfigures during recording can cause slow correlator sync.
    Any reconfigure can slow sync at JIVE.

    Recording started before scan start time   110 times.  See PRESTART and MINPAUSE.
    They may have been kept running through short scan gaps.
    The number can be large because each station/scan combination counts.

EFFECT OF SOLAR CORONA

  The solar corona can cause unstable phases for sources too close to the Sun.
  SCHED provides warnings at individual scans for distances less than 10 degrees.
  The distance from the Sun to each source in this schedule is:
    Source         Sun distance (deg) 
   0316+413            95.9

  Barry Clark estimates from predictions by Ketan Desai of IPM scattering sizes 
  that the Sun will cause amplitude reductions on the  longest VLBA baselines 
  at a solar distance of 60deg F^(-0.6) where F is in GHz. 
  For common VLBI bands, this is: 
       327 MHz        117. deg 
       610 MHz         81. deg 
       1.6 GHz         45. deg 
       2.3 GHz         36. deg 
       5.0 GHz         23. deg 
       8.4 GHz         17. deg 
      15.0 GHz         12. deg 
      22.0 GHz          9. deg 
      43.0 GHz          6. deg
