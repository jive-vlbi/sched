 
    Welcome to pySCHED version 1.28.0 based on
    SCHED version: 12.0 Release 12.0; March 2025
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
Bug reports, feature requests and other discussions can be posted on the GitHub page:
    https://github.com/jive-vlbi/sched
pySCHED will use the catalogs under /home/bobeldering/.pysched unless $SCHED is set.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Check 'sched.py -h' for command line paramters.
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   MAKECRD                :  Make crd file.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

WRTMSG: Special message from routine AUTODOWN:
 
  * Stations using automatic tape allocation or disk recording systems
    are being removed from scans when the source is below the antenna
    pointing limits.  This behavior can be overridden using DODOWN.
 
SCHOPT:  There will be 14 output scans (1 - 14) from 56/13:30:00 to 56/18:22:00
CHKSCN:     1 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.

WSTRBORK has   14 Tsys measurements. Maximum interval =   22 minutes.
Tsys calibration at most MkIV stations is taken during every gap in recording,
but these appear over 15 min apart for the stations listed above!
This can be improved by inserting gaps at regular intervals.
Note this is not an issue for Westerbork or Arecibo.
 
WRTMSG: Special message from routine VXSCH:
For most MkIV stations (e.g. most of the EVN) the calibration diode is
only fired during gaps in recording. Although the total power is
monitored continuously during scans, the calibration diode must be
fired regularly to allow these total power levels to be accurately
converted to system temperatures. It is recommended that, where
possible, you leave a gap in recording at least every 15 minutes to
allow the system temperature measurements. The gap should be at least
15 seconds, but you should also try to ensure that these gaps are long
enough that all the antennas are on source before the next scan
starts. Note that warnings about Westerbork and Arecibo can be safely
ignored because they have continuous system temperature measurements.
