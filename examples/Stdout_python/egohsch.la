EFFECT OF SOLAR CORONA

  The solar corona can cause unstable phases for sources too close to the Sun.
  SCHED provides warnings at individual scans for distances less than 10 degrees.
  The distance from the Sun to each source in this schedule is:
    Source         Sun distance (deg) 
   SRC1               140.5
   CAL1               149.7

  Barry Clark estimates from predictions by Ketan Desai of IPM scattering sizes 
  that the Sun will cause amplitude reductions on the  longest VLBA baselines 
  at a solar distance of 60deg F^(-0.6) where F is in GHz. 
  For common VLBI bands, this is: 
       327 MHz        117. deg 
       610 MHz         81. deg 
       1.6 GHz         45. deg 
       2.3 GHz         36. deg 
       5.0 GHz         23. deg 
       8.4 GHz         17. deg 
      15.0 GHz         12. deg 
      22.0 GHz          9. deg 
      43.0 GHz          6. deg
