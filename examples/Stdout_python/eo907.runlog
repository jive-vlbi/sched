 
    Welcome to pySCHED version 1.8.2 based on
    SCHED version: 11.5 Release 11.5; September 2018
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
pySCHED will use the catalogs under /export/jive/eldering/.pysched unless $SCHED is set.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Check 'sched.py -h' for command line paramters.
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

INPUT:   Found   220 input scans.
SHORTN: WARNING - Source names longer than 8 characters used.
        This will be a problem if geodetic software (SOLV etc) is used.
        This might be a problem on some correlators.
SCHOPT:  First output scan will be number 1
SCHOPT:  There will be 220 output scans (1 - 220) from 359/07:00:00 to 359/18:07:00
DOPFQ: *** Frequencies of channels set by DOPPLER overlap more than 20%.
           Was that intentional?
CHKSCN:   202 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file eo907.sum
STALST:  WARNING - A station has zero axis offset, which is unlikely.
         Accurate positions, including axis offsets are needed for correlation.
         Is your station location information adequate?
         See the summary file station list to see which stations are suspect.
OMSOUT:  Writing OMS file eo907.oms
Writing V E X file eo907.vex
WARNING, Phase cal not under computer control for some stations.
Contact stations by e-mail to make sure phase cal is switched off.
Phase cal is under computer control for VLBA stations and many others.
