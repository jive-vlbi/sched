 
    Welcome to pySCHED version 1.14.2 based on
    SCHED version: 11.6 Release 11.6; Feburary 2020
 
The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html
pySCHED will use the catalogs under /export/jive/eldering/.pysched unless $SCHED is set.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog
 
Check 'sched.py -h' for command line paramters.
Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

INPUT:   Found   125 input scans.
SHORTN: WARNING - Source names longer than 8 characters used.
        This will be a problem if geodetic software (SOLV etc) is used.
        This might be a problem on some correlators.
SCHOPT:  First output scan will be number 1
 
WRTMSG: Special message from routine AUTODOWN:
 
  * Stations using automatic tape allocation or disk recording systems
    are being removed from scans when the source is below the antenna
    pointing limits.  This behavior can be overridden using DODOWN.
 
SCHOPT:  There will be 125 output scans (1 - 125) from 360/11:00:00 to 360/23:06:03
CHKSCN:    51 scans had more than half the antennas arrive on-source after the start time.
              This could be normal if using duration scheduling with small gaps.
SUMOPE:  Writing summary file eo999.sum
STALST:  WARNING - A station has zero axis offset, which is unlikely.
         Accurate positions, including axis offsets are needed for correlation.
         Is your station location information adequate?
         See the summary file station list to see which stations are suspect.
