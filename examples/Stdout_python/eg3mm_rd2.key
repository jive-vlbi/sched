!  An example sched input file for VLBA observations at 3mm using
!  the RDBE with the PFB personality.
!
!  This shows how to schedule reference pointing using masers where
!  Doppler calculations and narrow bandwidths are required, but
!  cannot be supported by the RDBE_PFB.  The reference pointing is done,
!  for now (2013), using power data from the legacy system BBCs.  Those
!  units can have their frequencies and bandwidths set independently
!  of the RDBE channels.  Until Sept. 2013, doing that with SCHED
!  required separate MARK5C and MARK5A schedules.  This file does
!  it with a single schedule using the CRDDOP and CRDBW input parameters,
!  which are similar to the DOPPLER and BW parameters that affect
!  the main observing channels.

!  This example is adapted from eg3mm_rdbe.key which used the two 
!  schedules technique.  That file was adapted from eg3mmb.key 
!  with the main change being the use of an RDBE setup and the 
!  use of the piggyback system.

!  Original 2000aug08 Craig Walker and Vivek Dhawan
!  Modified 10oct2000 RCW for better reference pointing.
!  Modified 21nov2000 RCW. Convert to autopeak.
