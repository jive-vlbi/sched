!  SAMPLE SCHED INPUT FOR EXPERIMENT PLANNING.
!  
!  This file shows how to use SCHED to determine times when sources
!  are available, possible uv coverage, sky distribution etc.
!
!  OPTMODE=UPTIME is used to generate a psuedo schedule in which
!  each source has a day long string of scans, all on the same
!  day.  The summary file and the plotting capabilities can then 
!  be used to obtain the desired planning information.
!  Note, SCHED will not make telescope control files when
!  OPTMODE=UPTIME because the time order of scans is not enforced.
!
!  These capabilities should replace the Caltech package program
!  UPTIME for most purposes (I hope all).
!
!  Start SCHED interactively and specify the line (without the !):
!   plot  schedule=egplan.key  /
!
!  manual_simp.key is an even simpler example that will do the same
!  thing as this file.
!
!  To use for planets, restrict to the VLBA only and uncomment the
!  ephfile line and the planet scan lines.
