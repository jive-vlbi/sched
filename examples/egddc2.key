!
!   The DDC personality in the RDBE allows far more tuning 
!   flexibility then the PFB personality.  But there are 
!   restrictions on the actual frequencies that can be chosen.
!
!   The first processing step by the DDC personality is to break
!   the 512 MHz wide IF (512 to 1024 MHz) into three blocks
!   (512-640, 640-896, and 896-1024 MHz).  From there, frequency
!   shifting and filtering happens within one of those blocks.
!   We call the boundaries between the blocks crossover freqencies.
!   They are fixed and a single output baseband channel cannot 
!   get good data from both sides of one.  SCHED will warn of 
!   attempts to do so.

!   The DDC can set frequencies that are multiples of 1024 MHz (the 
!   sample rate) divided by powers of 2.  The finest setting is 
!   0.0596046 Hz.  But any frequency that does not have an integer 
!   number of cycles in one second can cause big problems with 
!   carrying phase over various events like frequency switches.  
!   So the settings should be limited to multiples of 15.625 kHz - 
!   the smallest setting that has an integer number of cycles in a 
!   second.  This can be looked at as N*125 kHz + 0, 15.625, 
!   31.250, 46.875, 62.500, 78.125, 93.750, or 109.375 kHz.  Sched 
!   will not accept settings that are not multiples of 15.625 kHz.  

!   Note that any crd files (old system) written for some of these 
!   DDC frequency settings will have BBC frequencies rounded to the 
!   nearest 10 kHz as required by the old hardware.
!   
!   Do a 4 IF case.
