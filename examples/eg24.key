!  This is a somewhat contrived example of a 24 hour schedule that
!  can be wrapped around the clock to start at times that might be
!  convenient for dynamic scheduling.
!
!  It shows a commenting style to give VLBA operations guidance 
!  on places that would be good alternate start times.
!
!  To accomplish the wrap, the parameters WRAP24 and DOSCANS are used.
!  WRAP24 causes the entire schedule to be duplicated, so it lasts 48
!  hours.  The full 2 days are shown in the summary file.  Then DOSCANS
!  is used to select the desired 24 hours (or other time, for that 
!  matter.  Normally the user will provide the 24 hour schedule and
!  VLBA operations will use WRAP24 and DOSCANS. 
!
!  Written, mostly, by Walter Brisken.
!  Modified slightly and put in the SCHED system Sept. 18, 2011 by RCW.
!  Other than the 24 hr aspect, this is a rather generic schedule.
!  Some day it should be combined with another simple schedule like
!  egvlba.key.
!  WRAP24 and DOSCANS added Feb. 9, 2013.  RCW.
!  Convert to RDBE_DDC, mostly by using 8 rather than 16 channel 
!  setups. Jan. 11, 2014  RCW

!   Preferred Dynamic Constraints.  Alter [defaults] as desired.
! ================================================================
! Equipment constraints:
!    Stations.  Below each station code, the "o" indicates an
!       [optional] station that is to be used if it is available.
!       Change "o" to "r" if the station is required or change
!       "o" to "n" if the station is not to be used.

!       Minimum number of stations [9 (6 for 3mm)]:  7
!    Bands and polarizations.  Below each band code, insert "R" 
!       if the righthand polarization is to be used, "L" if the
!       lefthand polarization is to be used, "d" if dual 
!       polarizations are to be used, or "o" if the band is in
!       your setups but scheduling should not be constrained by
!       its availability.

! Weather constraints: 
!    [appropriate for bands marked "L", "R", or "d" above
!     and for at least the minimum number of stations]
! Date constraints:
!    Preferred date(s), usually a series start: 
!    Excluded dates plus reason [none]:
!    Preferred interval between segments in days [none]:
!    Special conditions (e.g., a series with different
!       spacings in time): nighttime observations
! Start-time constraints:
!    Start-time range in (hhmm - hhmm), in PT_LST [none]: 
!            24hr file with start times every hour
