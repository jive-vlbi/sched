!  Example of a control file using the new RDBE and MARK5C
!  wideband digital backend and recorder.  This is mainly 
!  a vehicle for testing the standard RDBE_PFB setup files.
!  It simply goes through all of them to make sure they work.
!  The GBT and EB_RDBE are included so occasionally sideband
!  inversion gets invoked.
!  Started Jan. 21, 2013.

! ==========================================================
! =======================  Setup files  ====================
! ==========================================================
!  RDBE  Setups using the PFB personality.
!  The bbsyn values must be N*32 + 16 for N between 17 and 32
!  The N=32 option will give corrupted data, but is needed if it is
!  desired to put all 16 channels in one polarization as in the
!  second example setup.
!
!  Note that bbsyn = abs( freqref + freqoff - firstlo ) and is 
!  the frequency within the IF of the DC edge of the output baseband
!  channel.  The firstlo value is normally picked up from the 
!  frequency file.  Here freqref has been set to equal the firstlo 
!  so that freqoff is the frequency in the IF - same as bbsyn.
!
!  For reference, the allowed values of bbsyn (or freqoff here) are:
!  bbsyn = 528.0, 560.0, 592.0,  624.0, 656.0, 688.0, 720.0,  752.0,
!          784.0, 816.0, 848.0,  880.0, 912.0, 944.0, 976.0, 1008.0
!
!  In the first example setup, 5MHz pcal is used as it makes a bit
!  more sense with these bandwidths.  But it does mean that the tones
!  (derived from 5 pulses per microsecond rather than 1) add more
!  to the system noise.  The second setup takes the default 1 MHz 
!  and is probably better for science, as opposed to test, observations.
