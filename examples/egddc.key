!
!   The DDC personality in the RDBE allows far more tuning 
!   flexibility then the PFB personality.  But there are 
!   restrictions on the actual frequencies that can be chosen.
!
!   The first processing step by the DDC personality is to break
!   the 512 MHz wide IF (512 to 1024 MHz) into three blocks
!   (512-640, 640-896, and 896-1024 MHz).  From there, frequency
!   shifting and filtering happens within one of those blocks.
!   We call the boundaries between the blocks crossover freqencies.
!   They are fixed and a single output baseband channel cannot 
!   get good data from both sides of one.  SCHED will warn of 
!   attempts to do so.
!
!   Note that the DDC characteristics are not yet final as of
!   when this was written (Apr. 2011).

!   The DDC can set frequencies that are multiples of 1024 MHz (the 
!   sample rate) divided by powers of 2.  The finest setting is 
!   0.0596046 Hz.  But any frequency that does not have an integer 
!   number of cycles in one second can cause big problems with 
!   carrying phase over various events like frequency switches.  
!   So the settings should be limited to multiples of 15.625 kHz - 
!   the smallest setting that has an integer number of cycles in a 
!   second.  This can be looked at as N*125 kHz + 0, 15.625, 
!   31.250, 46.875, 62.500, 78.125, 93.750, or 109.375 kHz.  Sched 
!   will not accept settings that are not multiples of 15.625 kHz.  

!   Note that any crd files (old system) written for some of these 
!   DDC frequency settings will have BBC frequencies rounded to the 
!   nearest 10 kHz as required by the old hardware.

!  This file accumulates uv coverage in 4 bands.
!  In the process, it tests the on-line setting of IF, LO, etc
!  switches by exercizing the various special cases:
!      Receiver has an interal mix (1cm, 7mm, 3mm)
!      IF converter has internal filters (6cm new, 2cm)
!      IF converter has an optional narrow filter (50cm)
!      Also test normal case.

!  When not using DWELL, leave time for long slews with GAP.
!  Allow a readback test occasionally.
!  Only things that change need to be specified.

!  MK is not up at the start.

!  The second scan below sets up a valid frequency that the DDC can
!  use but that requires more digits in the output files than
!  the old standard of the nearest 10 kHz. It is here to test
!  that the extra digits are printed where needed.  Note that
!  the old system (crd files) cannot set beyond 10 kHz, so 
!  fewer digits are still used there.  Note also that odd 
!  frequencies such as these could be put in the setup files.
