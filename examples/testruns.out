    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:   6.0  Release: March 2005

The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog

Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

SUMOPE:  Writing summary file eg3mma.sum
 Processing VLBA_FD
 Processing VLBA_PT
 Processing VLBA_KP
 Processing VLBA_LA
 REMINDER - see sched.runlog for most run time messages.

    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:   6.0  Release: March 2005

The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog

Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

SCHTIM: Caution: Only     7 readback tests (2 min gaps) at WSTRBORK
        Please try for at least one readback each two hours.

VXSCH: Tsys calibration is taken every new scan, but these appear over 15 min apart!
       This can be improved by splitting up individual tape passes in multiple scans.

    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:   6.0  Release: March 2005

The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog

Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

    Welcome to program SCHED.  Version:   6.0  Release: March 2005

The manual is at http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html
Unix users should set $SCHED to the base area where SCHED is installed.
Most run time messages will be in sched.runlog

Some useful commands to give now if running interactively:
   SCHedule=<filename>    :  Specify input file.
   PLOT                   :  Invokes uv, xy, rd, and uptime plotting.
   FREQLIST=lowF,highF    :  Make frequency list (MHz).  Then exit.
   EXIT                   :  Leave program.
   /                      :  End of inputs - run program (or EXIT).

SHORTN: WARNING - Source names longer than 8 characters used.
        Mark III correlators and geodetic software will have problems.
