!   Example schedule for VLBA+GBT observations
!    with 512 Mbps recorded bit rate.  
!
!   This used to use  2 tape drives on the VLBA and 2 heads 
!   on MKIV, but now just uses disk modules.  Still uses 8 and
!   16 MHz baseband bandwidths, which are compatible with other
!   old systems.

!  Note that these setups will use an LO of 4100 MHz at the VLBA
!  (and 5636 at the GBT).  The crossovers are at 4740 and 4996 MHz.
!  The latter one is very close to the old network standard frequency
!  of 4990 MHz.  So drop to lower frequencies, and avoid the crossover
!  by at least 10 MHz.  Both files used a FREQREF=4990.99 before the
!  conversion to the RDBE.  Change to .25 on the end for a pulse-cal
!  friendly setting that can be reached by the RDBE, and drop the MHz
!  to avoid the crossover.
