!   Example schedule for Mark IV observations
!   with 1024 Mbps recorded bit rate.  This uses 2 heads and
!   16 Mbps per track.
!
!   Created originally for testing purposes: H.J. van Langevelde
!   Adapted as a SCHED example: R.C. Walker  28 Dec 2000.
!   Adapted for 1024 Mbps from eg512g.key by R.C. Walker  19 Feb 2003.
!
!   Adapted for DISK use - make sure there are gaps for Tys measurements
!   every 15 min and also gaps for Mark5 diskbank changes
!
!   "*" in M31* removed.  The VEX parser doesn't like it.  April 11, 2014 RCW.

! ===================  Source Catalog  =====================
! ==========================================================

! Get source coordinates for fringe finders, phase-reference
! source, etc, from the DEFAULT catalog
! The main source catalog options are sources.gsfc (Goddard)
!  and sources.rfc (Petrov).

srcfile = $SCHED/catalogs/sources.gsfc

! But my (Huib?) favourite strong, polarised source isn't in the DEFAULT
! catalog so I shall specify that separately.  Also, J0045+4555
! had dropped out of the standard catalog, presumably because the
! position was unreliable (only 2 observations).  The entry here
! is taken from sources.vlba that was in use up to Nov. 2010.
! Note that this source is in more recent catalogs with more observations,
! but keep here for purposes of the example.
!
! This example used to have the first sources as "M31*".  But it
! was learned that the VEX parser does not like the '*', so that was
! dropped.  Generally characters other than letters, numbers, + and - are not
! recommended.

!  The schedule is adapted for DISK based recording
!
!  TSYS measurement information:
!  
!  PIs should keep in mind that MarkIV DAR stations measure the 
!  noise diode whenever there is an appropriate gap in recording.
!  A measurement on the noise diode  every 15 min is reccomended
!
!  SCHED also requires that there is a gap of at least 
!  22 min (for 1024Gb/s recording) to enable proper switching of 
!  diskpacks

! Now the phase-reference and target source loop
!  
! Since the JODRELL BANK LOVELL Telescope ("jodrell1"), used here, is restricted 
! in the frequency of source changes to no more than 12 per hour, for phase-referencing 
! experiments, either a cycle times of 10 mins can be sustained (e.g.  3m cal + 7m target). 
! OR in this case where we require faster cycle times, one scan of the phase-calibrator is 
! omited instead by re-issuing the "STATIONS= " command.
