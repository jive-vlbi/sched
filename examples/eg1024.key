!   Example schedule for Mark IV observations
!   with 1024 Mbps recorded bit rate.  This uses 2 heads and
!   16 Mbps per track.
!
!   Created originally for testing purposes: H.J. van Langevelde
!   Adapted as a SCHED example: R.C. Walker  28 Dec 2000.
!   Adapted for 1024 Mbps from eg512g.key by R.C. Walker  19 Feb 2003.
!
!   For testing purposes, there are a couple of lines that 
!   swapped to trigger postpass related warnings: look for 
!   !go_warn or !go_ok
!
!   Control code and print requests
