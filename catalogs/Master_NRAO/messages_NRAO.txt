                   SCHED MESSAGE FILE

This file contains messages that SCHED may wish to write to the
log file if something needs explanation.  Each message is preceeded
by a line starting with ++ and giving the message name.  A line 
starting with -- is not passed by SCHED to the log file.  It is
useful to record which subroutine requests the message.  The routine
WRTMSG reads this file and writes the message.

++eqep
--Called by SRREAD

You have used both EQUINOX and EPOCH in your source lists to set the
EQUINOX for precession.  EPOCH used to be used for this purpose, but
that is not really correct as became apparent when stellar proper
motions were introduced.  EQUINOX is now the proper veriable to use
for the purpose and the valid arguments are 'J2000', 'B1950', and
'DATE'.  SCHED tolerates the use of EPOCH for this purpose for 
backwards compatibility.  But if both are used, SCHED does not know
which to believe.  This can happen when you have some sources in a
SRCCAT section in the keyin input file and still use EPOCH while the
main source catalogs distributed with SCHED use EQUINOX.  Please
convert all source lists you are using to EQUINOX.

++expcode
--Called by CHKCODE

======================================================================
  WARNING   The project code (EXPCODE) for this observation has a 
            non-standard format.  Valid codes start with one or two 
            letters followed by 3 digits.  Any leading zeros should 
            be included.  A couple of valid examples are bt068 
            and v003.

            Note that some SCHED examples use non-valid codes, as do
            VLBA test observations.

++vlaflukephase
--Called by CHKVLA

======================================================================
  WARNING   The Fluke synthesizers at the VLA (pre EVLA) are used to 
            fine tune the VLA frequency.  They have the property that
            they do not necessarily return to the same phase if the
            frequency is set to something other than a multiple of
            10 MHz.  This is ok for the VLA because all antennas use
            the same Fluke signals.  But it will spoil phase coherence
            between scans for frequency switched VLBI (or EVLA) 
            observations.

            This schedule has setups with different VLA Fluke settings
            and at least one is not a multiple of 10 MHz.  Therefore
            you are at risk of random phase changes between scans for
            the VLA.  This may or may not be a problem depending on 
            the nature of the observations.  If you don't plan to carry
            phase between scans separated by scans at other frequencies,
            then there should not be a problem.  If you are doing some
            sort of combined frequency switching and phase referencing,
            then it won't work.

++freqcatwarning
--Called by SETFCAT

  There is inadequate information to specify a setup without
  information from the frequency catalog.
  If there is a frequency catalog entry for what you want, the
  setup file must contain at least:
  STATION, FREQREF, POL, BBFILTER, BITS, and NCHAN.
  If there is no appropriate entry in the catalog, you will 
  need more.    See the manual.' )

++freqnomatch
--Called by SETFCAT

                    -----------  WARNING  -----------
SCHED could not find a frequency catalog group that matched the setup file
and station mentioned above.  Below are the closest matches with at least 
some overlap in RF frequency.  You can use FREQLIST (a main program input) 
to get the frequency catalog group and IF numbers that are available.  Or
you can look in freq.dat in the catalogs area.

Since SCHED cannot confirm the validity of your setup, check and be very 
sure it is correct!

In the table below, a match is indicated by a T.  A mismatch is indicated by F.

++goofyepoch
--Called by SRREAD

You have specified an EPOCH that is unlikely to be correct.  It
cannot be interpreted as what used to be called EPOCH but is
now EQUINOX (valid options are J2000, B1950, and DATE) and it
is not a date between 1900 and 2100.  It is likely that you
specified something like J1991.25 as may be apparent from the
character form shown above.  Sched will proceed using what you
specified as the reference date for proper motions, but it is
very likely that this is not what you really want.

++modtst
--Called by OKMODES

                -------------  WARNING  ---------------
You have specified MODETEST in a setup file.  This makes it possible
to record observations that cannot be correlated.  Please do not use
this parameter unless you absolutely have to.  If you do, it is best
to communicate with correlator support personnel to be sure that the
data will be usable.


++noassignbbc
--Called by BBCALT

BBCALT could not assign a BBC to channel ICHAN (see above) in the
setup file given above.  The allowed IF channels from the frequency
catalog are given above as IFNAME and alternate ALTIFC.  The number of
BBCs assumed to be available at station is given above as NNBBC
The setup information already available will be shown below.

++oldspeed
--Called from RDSET.

You have specified the tape speed using the setup file parameter
TPSPEED.  This is an obsolete way of specifying this parameter.
You should use TPSPEEDH and TPSPEEDL here in the setup file, or 
better yet, let SCHED use its defaults, which are good for almost
all circumstances.

++padloss
--Called from CHKSOC.

CHKSOC: *** WARNING ***  You have requested a fanout of 4 and
        the ZEROPAD correlator weighting function.  That will 
        cause half the data not to be used (cannot overlap the FFTs).
        The automatic setting of FORMAT does not understand this.  
        You may need to force FORMAT in the setup.

++polerr
--Called from CHKSOC.

CHKSOC:  Track assignments were specified that cannot be polarization 
         processed in Socorro. It is safest to assign polarization
         pairs to adjacent channels.  Try that, let SCHED make the
         track assignments, or contact an expert for help.

++rollerr
--Called from CHKSOC.

CHKSOC:  Channels to be processed in Socorro as a polarization pair
         must be assigned to the same roll group when barrel rolling 
         is on. It is safest to assign polarization pairs to adjacent 
         channels.

++scanremoval
--Called from AUTODOWN

  * Stations using automatic tape allocation or disk recording systems
    are being removed from scans when the source is below the antenna 
    pointing limits.  This behavior can be overridden using DODOWN.

++taperunning
--Called from SETTPS

  Tape is being kept running through short gaps between scans.
Add TPSTART to the SUMITEM list to see details.
MINPAUSE and PRESTART may be used to adjust.
Remember MINPAUSE is multiplied by the speed up factor.

++vlaover24
--Called from CHKVLA

This schedule is over 24 hours and contains the VLA.  That is not
wise.  VLA telescope files do not have a day associated with each
scan, so, if there is a restart after the first 24 hours are up,
observing may resume on the wrong (previous day's) scan.

++resync
--Called by CHKSCN

WARNING: More than 10% of the on-source, in-scan time in this schedule
will be lost to correlator resyncs at at least one station.
Correlator resyncs happen when the recordings stop and restart and
when certain reconfigurations happen.  The details vary according to
the recording system and the correlator.

You can easily have excessive sync losses at the VLBA correlator if
you stop the tape too often, such as between every scan in a phase
referencing observation.  If this is happening, investigate the
parameters PRESTART and MINPAUSE to try to keep the recordings moving
between scans, or at least to start them before the nominal scan start
time to allow for correlator sync.  MarkIV correlators are less
sensitive to recording stoppages and JIVE is somewhere in between.

For the VLBA recording system, a formatter reconfiguration causes a
constant time code to be sent to the recording for about 8 seconds.
This is treated as bad data at the correlator and delays
synchronization.  In fact, on the VLBA correlator, it seems to be
worse than having stopped the recording during the reconfigure.  It
typically adds 15 seconds to the resync - 8 for the period of bad time
and 7 more added to the typical resync time.  But for 10-20% of cases,
the resync takes much longer - up to about 80 seconds.  If you must
have a formatter reconfiguration, it is much better to do it while the
recording is stopped.  Just adding a GAP of 20 seconds or more should
do it.

On the VLBA correlator, a resync takes about 8, 13, or 25 seconds of
record time for speedup factors of 1, 2, or 4 for tape (about 8
seconds of playback time).  For disk, it is currently about 10 seconds
of record time longer than that, although we hope to bring that down
to much shorter values.  

At JIVE there is no speedup.  Tape resyncs take about 20 seconds and
disk about 1 second.  The tape value is reduced to about 10 seconds if
the scan gap is less than about 20 seconds.  Resyncs take longer,
20-30 seconds if there is a new configuration that requires a new
subjob.  The causes are basically the same as the causes of formatter
reconfigurations (see below), except there is no sensitivity to pcal
setups.

The MarkIV correlators take about 10s to sync with tape and of order a
second with disk.  Since each scan is handled independently, there is
no sensitivity to configuration, other than that they could not
correlate the period of bad time code produced during a
reconfiguration.

A common reason for excessive resyncs on the VLBA is unintended
formatter reconfigures.  Reconfigures are caused by changes in the
number of channels, the sample rate, the fanout, the format, the
barrel roll, the track assignments, the BBC sideband, the number of
bits, the BBC assignments, and the pcal detector setup.  Basically
they happen whenever the switching in the formatter must change.

One subtle cause of unintended reconfigures on VLBA systems is changes
to the pcal setup forced by frequency changes.  If the kHz digits of
the baseband frequency settings change, the tone detector frequencies
have to change which triggers a reconfigure.  If the MHz digits
change, no pcal change is needed because there is a tone every MHz.
For example, if a baseband is set to 635.49 in one setup and 862.99 in
another, a reconfigure will be triggered when switching between them.
If one is 635.49 and the other is 862.49, the pcal tone frequency will
be the same and there will not be a reconfigure despite the large
difference in the MHz part.  When band switching, always try to keep
the basic setup (number of channels, bits etc) the same and keep the
kHz digits of the frequencies the same.  

Another not-so-obvious cause for formatter reconfigures is changes to
the BBC sideband.  Recall on the VLBA that the IF is net upper
sideband for 6 cm and up but is lower sideband for the 20cm and 13cm
(S and L bands) systems.  Typical standard setups use net upper
sidebands.  For 20cm and 13cm, this requires a lower sideband mix at
the BBC. Different BBC sidebands are sent to different samplers and
hence require the formatter to reconfigure its input switches when
there is a change.  This issue can be avoided by switching to net
lower sideband for the 20cm and 13cm systems.

It should essentially never be necessary to provoke reconfigurations,
even when switching between observing bands.


++freqbw
--Called by CHKSC1

CAUTION: You have set FREQ and/or BW for some scans but have not
changed them when switching to a new setup file.  These parameters do
not change from scan to scan unless forced.  It is possible that you
really did want them to change, perhaps to the value of the new setup
file.  Check what you have done carefully.  To cause SCHED to use the
setup file value, set FREQ=0 and/or BW=0.
