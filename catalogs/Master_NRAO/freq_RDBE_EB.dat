!  Just the EB_VLBA part of freq_ef_eb.dat, mostified by Craig Walker
!  Dec 2012-Jan 2012 for the RDBE.  The original file is (for now) in
!  /users/cwalker/files/sched_work/TEST/EVN_DBBC_TEST
!
!  The original file gives a selection of possible frequency setups for
!  EFLSBERG (DBBC terminal) and the EB_VLBA
!
!  The input parameters are:
!     STATION   Stations covered by this group.
!     PRIOrity  Lower values are favored groups.
!     RF1       Lower limit of RF frequencies covered by this group.
!     RF2       Upper RF limit.
!     POL       Polarization of this IF.
!     LO1       The sum of all LOs other than the BBC.
!     IFNAME    The name of the IF as used by control software.
!     FE        The front end name (mainly VLBA).
!     SYN       The 3 VLBA front end synthesizer settings.
!     DUALX     Use the wide band X band system on the VLBA.
!     CH1RF1    Lower hard RF limit for channel 1.  Mainly for 2cm VLBA.
!     CH1RF2    Upper hard RF limit for channel 1.  These select filter.
!     RCP50CM, LCP50CM  50 cm VLBA filter (NARROW or BROAD)
!
!  VLA specific items.  For the meaning of most, see the SCHED manual.

!  2012oct25 Update of Ef and Eb frequency ranges.
!
!  2012 dec 07 - 2013 Jan 17  Craig Walker.  Attempted update of EB_VLBA 
!       setups for use with RDBE and for compatibility with the VLBA.  
!       Many comments added and modified setups provided that allow the 
!       IF to match the IF at the VLBA.
!
!       For VLBA compatibility using the RDBE, it is very useful to have
!       the IF be identical to what the VLBA uses, although a sideband
!       inversion is ok as it can be fixed in DiFX (might not be ok with
!       all correlators).  The RF range should be the same, and the LO
!       should either be the same or, with sideband inversion, should 
!       be different by 1024+512=1536 MHz.  If the IFs don't match, for
!       the PFB personality, a sufficient number of 32 MHz baseband 
!       channels must match exactly.  Since there is no tuning flexibilty
!       of those channels (their edges are at 512+16+N*32 MHz in the IF)
!       the external LOs must be set carefully.  The DDC personality has
!       an initial polyphase filter that puts "crossover frequencies" at
!       640 and 896 MHz in the IF.  A baseband channel cannot get good
!       data from both sides of such a crossover.  If the external LOs
!       are not set the same, it is complicated, but not impossible, to
!       set baseband channels that are compatible and don't run into
!       problems with the crossovers.  For these reasons, it is much
!       preferred to have matching IFs.
!
!       Obtaining matching IFs runs into the problem that the VLBA LOs
!       have very restricted frequency set points.  They can only be set
!       to N*500+-100 MHz and must be between 2.1 and 15.9 GHz.  For 1cm
!       and higher frequency bands, two such LOs are used so the sum
!       is still restricted, but the allowed settings don't follow such
!       a simple rule.  See the VLBA part of freq.dat or freq_RDBE.dat
!       for allowed settings - the list is exhaustive.  There is an 
!       active project at the VLBA to make more flexible synthesizers,
!       but it will likely be at least 2014 before those are available.
!
!       The IF range for the RDBE is 512 to 1024 MHz which is offset
!       slightly from the 500 to 1000 MHz assumed for the legacy VLBA
!       system.  The IF filters haven't actually changed but they had
!       soft edges.  I have changed the frequency ranges of all setups
!       whose edges seemed to be set by the IF range to match the new
!       limits.  Where the limits looked like they were set by something
!       else (they weren't at 500 and 1000 MHz from the LO), I have left
!       them alone.  With the PFB personality, the 16 MHz at the edge 
!       of the IF end up in a corrupted, aliased channel and are not useful.
!       Thus the IF range for the PFB is really 528-1008 MHz.
!
!       From Dave Graham's email of Dec. 17, 2012, the IF switch box does 
!       not seem to work for them, so no IF switching.  Not sure of the 
!       full implications, but some band switching might not be allowed.  Ask.

!       A few of the old setups had frequency ranges that violated even
!       the legacy system constraints.  I have tried to fix those.
!       I have not touched the EFLSBERG section of this file.
!
!       I have initialed (RCW) my changes and comments.

!  20cm.
!RCW  Here are the important facts as I understand them (certainly imperfect) 
!  based on Dave Graham's email of Dec. 17, 2012, the old freq.dat file for 
!  the legacy system, on the constraints imposed by the VLBA system for 
!  joint observations and from the receiver information on 
!  http://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/effelsberg/receivers/receiver.html
!  Not all of these sources agree, so this needs to be checked.

!  NOTE: I don't know the LO constraints.  I will assume it is flexible 
!        until told otherwise.

!  Effelsberg properties:
!        The receiver range is 1290 - 1725 MHz.
!        The lower RF filter is 1290-1430 MHz
!        The upper RF filter is 1580-1725 MHz
!        IF range 80-220 MHz (web) or 100-250 (Graham).  Use 250 upper.
!        The IF is upconverted by 400 MHz which is fixed.
!        RDBE useful IF range: PFB - 528-650.  DDC - 512-650 
!        The DDC has a crossover at 640 so 640-650 is not very useful.
!        The LO1 values listed include the 400 MHz upshift
!        With the PFB, the boundaries of the usable filters are:
!           528, 560, 592, 624, 656 MHz in the IF after the upshift.

!  The related VLBA properties:
!      Useful LOs are 2100 and 2400 MHz with 2600 MHz possible if needed for
!        baseband placement or crossover avoidance.
!      With 2100 MHz relevant PFB filter boundaries are at:
!        1284, 1316, 1348, 1380, 1412, 1444, 1476, 1508, 1540, 1572
!        The DDC band limits and crossovers are 1076, 1205, 1460, and 1588 MHz
!      With 2400 MHz, the relevant PFB filters  are:
!        1392, 1424, 1456, 1488, 1520, 1552, 1584, 1616, 1648, 1680, 1712, 1744
!        The DDC band limits and crossovers are 1376, 1504, 1760, and 1888 MHz
!      With 2600 MHz, the relevant PFB filters  are:
!        1592, 1624, 1656, 1688, 1720, 1752 
!        The DDC band limits and crossovers are 1576, 1704, 1960, and 2088 MHz
! 
!   So here are my suggested setups.

!   The first two go to the low end of the receiver.
Name = eb_p1_1345  Station = EB_VLBA   priority = 0
!  For use with the PFB:
  rf1 = 1285, 1285    ifname = B,    D
  rf2 = 1406, 1406    fe  = '20cm', '20cm'
  pol =  RCP,  LCP    lo1 = 756  ! (1284-528) 1284 is a PFB edge for VLBA
  note = 'Prime focus receiver, new 2008 (lower edge)'
/
Name = eb_d1_1354  Station = EB_VLBA   priority = 0
!  For use with the DDC:  Crossover at 1413.  No VLBA crossover.
  rf1 = 1285, 1285    ifname = B,    D
  rf2 = 1423, 1423    fe  = '20cm', '20cm'
  pol =  RCP,  LCP    lo1 = 773  ! (1285-512)
  note = 'Prime focus receiver, new 2008 (lower edge)'
/

!   The next one is for both personalities and gets the 1420.4 MHz 
!   hydrogen line comfortably in a PFB channel
!   and away from a DDC crossover (at 1428)
!   This also gets to the high end of the lower RF filter.
Name = eb_pd2_1396  Station = EB_VLBA   priority = 0

  note = 'Prime focus receiver, new 2008 (lower edge)'
/

!RCW  The upper range for the EB receiver is 1580-1725.  In this range
!     the VLBA must use 2400 or 2600 MHz for the first LO.  See above for
!     the PFB boundaries.
!     For the DDC, there is no crossover in this range with the 2400 MHz LO.
!     With the 2600 MHz VLBA LO, there is a crossover at 1704 MHz.

!  This one is for use with the PFB and the VLBA 2400 MHz LO.
