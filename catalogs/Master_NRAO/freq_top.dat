!  FREQUENCY CATALOG for SCHED.
!
!  This file gives a selection of possible frequency setups for
!  many active VLBI stations.  For the VLBA, the selection is
!  basicaly complete - nearly all valid setups are included.  For
!  other stations, many of the frequently used setups are included.
!  SCHED can use this file to find the appropriate LO and IF settings
!  given the desired observing frequencies.  The user should not
!  need to know the hardware setups at the various stations.  In 
!  fact, users should avoid making their own frequency setups if
!  possible.  If the desired frequency is in this file, it won't 
!  be necessary to bother the station friends for information.  And
!  this file is kept reasonably up to date so it should be trusted
!  more than information in old schedules.
!
!  SCHED will also use this file to check against any user generated
!  setups.  If the user setup does not match one here, warnings will
!  be issued as a flag that the user should make doubly sure that 
!  the setup is ok.
!
!  The input parameters are:
!     STATION   Stations covered by this group.
!     PRIOrity  Lower values are favored groups.
!     RF1       Lower limit of RF frequencies covered by this group.
!     RF2       Upper RF limit.
!     POL       Polarization of this IF.
!     LO1       The sum of all LOs other than the BBC.
!     IFNAME    The name of the IF as used by control software.
!     FE        The front end name (mainly VLBA).
!     SYN       The 3 VLBA front end synthesizer settings.
!     DUALX     Use the wide band X band system on the VLBA.
!     CH1RF1    Lower hard RF limit for channel 1.  Mainly for 2cm VLBA.
!     CH1RF2    Upper hard RF limit for channel 1.  These select filter.
!     RCP50CM, LCP50CM  50 cm VLBA filter (NARROW or BROAD)
!
!  VLA specific items.  For the meaning of most, see the SCHED manual.
!     CHNSTA    Used to show if IF is phased array or single dish. (obsolete)
!     VLABAND, VLABW, VLAFEAB, VLAFECD, VLASYNA, VLASYNB, FLUKEA, FLUKEB
!
!
!  For each of the VLBA bands, a summary of significant filters and 
!  LO's is given in the comments.
!  Receiver and filter ranges are to nominal 1/2 power points.
!  The "maximum range" and "good range" are taken from examination of
!  plots of measured data in VLBA Test Memo 51.  These are subjective, 
!  eyeball estimates.  Anyone attempting to schedule near the limits 
!  should look at Memo 51.

!  The protected bands in the U.S., that are within VLA or VLBA 
!  bands, are (from VLA-VLBA Interference Memo No 3):
!       73.00 - 74.60 MHz  Primary

!
!  The full frequency catalog (freq.dat) is maintained in subset files.
!  All changes should be made in those files, not in freq.dat itself.
!  Any changes made directly to freq.dat will be lost at the next update.
!
!  This top information is contained in a file called 
!  Master_NRAO/freq_top.dat.
!
!
!  Before 25mar97 - merge the NRAO and EVN versions Huib-03/97
!  25mar97 split freq.dat into rcwfreq.dat and huibfreq.dat.
!  28Jul97 Various changes including VLA digital patch panel.
!  08Aug97 Some changes to EVN stations and GB 6cm.
!  09Oct97 Split rcwfreq.dat and huibfreq.dat into freq_VLBA.dat etc.
!  .... History not maintained for a long time.
!  2004mar01 Rewrite some of above.  Add 86 GHz VLBA frequencies.  RCW.
