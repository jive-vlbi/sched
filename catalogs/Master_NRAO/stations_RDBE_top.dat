!  Stations Catalog stations_RDBE.dat for SCHED.
!
!     This is the verion of the stations catalog for use with the 
!     digital data aquisition systems.  On the VLBA, this means 
!     the RDBE, with 2 RDBE's per station.  On many other stations, 
!     this will be the DBBC.
!
!     Do not modify the standard copy of stations_RDBE.dat directly.  It is 
!     the combination of a number of "Master" files.  See proceedure 
!     Update to see what is involved.  Users making a special version
!     can modify private versions of stations_RDBE.dat at will.

!  
!   NOTES:
!     1.  These items appear redundant with STCODE, STATION, and MOUNT, but
!         reflect the contents of the VLBA correlator data base which can
!         be, and often is, different from what is used in SCHED for 
!         scheduling.  Often this difference reflects the refusal by the
!         array schedulers to specify before observe time which specific 
!         antenna is going to be used for single dish observations at places 
!         like the VLA and Westerbork.  Therefore STCODE does not contain
!         this information.  But the correlator must know and has separate
!         database entries for each pad (gets which was used from the log).
!         AXISTYPE is there as a consistency check.  SCHED users do not 
!         need to specify DBCODE, DBNAME, or AXISTYPE if providing their 
!         own catalog for SCHED.
!     2.  At least one of (ELEV, LAT, LONG) or (X, Y, Z) must be provided.
!         It is a bad idea to provide both.  SCHED will calculate the 
!         missing one from the one provided.  Note if ELEV is large, 
!         (ELEV, LAT, LONG) are treated as geocentric.  If it is small,
!         they are treated as geodetic.
!     3.  *** WARNING: SCHED uses the first 4 characters in many places 
!         to detect a true VLBA station.  Those characters should only be VLBA
!         if all the hardware all the way up the antenna is VLBA type.

!  Feb.  3, 1994 - Update to Barry Clark station codes.
!  Jan.  5, 1993 - New station codes and SN50 control.
!                  Codes are the ones recommended by Porcas except for
!                  a few single letter codes and a few 3 letter codes for DSN.

!                - Make station names consistent with pc-sched and sked. RCW
!                - pc-sched and sked catalogs don't agree on all parameters.
!                - This whole area needs help.

!                  separate RDBE2 version.  In Update, add all the
!                  non-VLBA stations to the RDBE version.
