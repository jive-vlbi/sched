!  Primary Stations Catalog for SCHED.
!
!     Do not modify the standard copy of stations.dat directly.  It is 
!     the combination of a number of "Master" files.  See proceedure 
!     Update to see what is involved.  Users making a special version
!     can modify stations.dat at will.
!
!  INPUT PARAMETERS:
!      Parm   Note  Description

!     DESCRIP       Any text.
!     NDRIVES       The number of tape drives at the station.
!     HOR_AZ        A list of azimuths at which the horizon is measured.
!     HOR_EL        The horizon elevation at the above azimuths.
!     MOUNT         The mount type as used by SCHED.
!     AXISTYPE   1  The mount type according to the VLBA correlator database.
!     AXISOFF       The offset between the axes.
!     AX1LIM        Slew limits for first axis for several regions.
!     AX2LIM        Slew limits for the second axis in the same regions.
!     AX1RATE       The first axis slew rate.
!     AX2RATE       The second axis slew rate.
!     AX1ACC        Acceleration in deg/s/s, first axis
!     AX2ACC        Acceleration in deg/s/s, second axis
!     TSETTLE       Extra time required for source change beyond dist/rate.
!     MINSETUP      Minimum time between scans when using DWELL.
!  
!   NOTES:
!     1.  These items appear redundant with STCODE, STATION, and MOUNT, but
!         reflect the contents of the VLBA correlator data base which can
!         be, and often is, different from what is used in SCHED for 
!         scheduling.  Often this difference reflects the refusal by the
!         array schedulers to specify before observe time which specific 
!         antenna is going to be used for single dish observations at places 
!         like the VLA and Westerbork.  Therefore STCODE does not contain
!         this information.  But the correlator must know and has separate
!         database entries for each pad (gets which was used from the log).
!         AXISTYPE is there as a consistency check.  SCHED users do not 
!         need to specify DBCODE, DBNAME, or AXISTYPE if providing their 
!         own catalog for SCHED.
!     2.  At least one of (ELEV, LAT, LONG) or (X, Y, Z) must be provided.
!         It is a bad idea to provide both.  SCHED will calculate the 
!         missing one from the one provided.  Note if ELEV is large, 
!         (ELEV, LAT, LONG) are treated as geocentric.  If it is small,
!         they are treated as geodetic.
!     3.  *** WARNING: SCHED uses the first 4 characters in many places 
!         to detect a true VLBA station.  Those characters should only be VLBA
!         if all the hardware all the way up the antenna is VLBA type.

!   HISTORY  (rather incomplete)
!
!  May. 12, 1989 - VLBA stations updated to VLBA Memo 644 (done later?)
!  Feb.  3, 1994 - Update to Barry Clark station codes.
!  Jan.  5, 1993 - New station codes and SN50 control.
!                  Codes are the ones recommended by Porcas except for
!                  a few single letter codes and a few 3 letter codes for DSN.
!  Dec.  5, 1994 - Remove HCRK control type.  
!  Jan. 17, 1995 - Added VLBA horizon information (150K limit). RCW 
!  Nov. 18, 1995   Added VLBA mount information. RCW
!  Feb. 15, 1996 - Add slew information for many sites. RCW
!                - Make station names consistent with pc-sched and sked. RCW
!                - pc-sched and sked catalogs don't agree on all parameters.
!                - This whole area needs help.
!  Dec.  2, 1996 - Add some Japanese stations.  Note in last months various
!                  parameters like DAR, RECORDER etc were added.
!  Mar. 14, 1997 - Merge with "huibstat.dat" to include VEX and 
!                  Mark IV info. RCW.  Huibstat.dat from Huib vanLangevelde.
!  Mar. 25, 1997 - Incorporate changes to EVN etc stations from Huib.
!  Mar. 25, 1997 - Split into rcwstat.dat and huibstat.dat for maintenance.
!                  From now on, stations.dat is the two catted together.
!                  Do not modify it directly.
!  Oct.     1997 - More splits - to stations_APT.dat, stations_DSN.dat,
!                  stations_US.dat, stations_geodesy.dat, stations_EVN.dat,
!                  and stations_mm.dat.
!  Nov.  5, 1997 - Add some S2 entries for Green Bank, Arecibo ...
!  Feb. 25, 1998 - Setting up to get station locations from correlator 
!                  data base.
!  --            - Probably did not document a bunch of changes.
!  Jan. 23, 2001 - Point ARECIBO position to locations.dat.  RCW
!  Apr. 23, 2001 - More Arecibo information prior to test.  RCW.
!  Oct. 15,16 2001 - Fix some Arecibo stuff.
!  Dec. 28, 2001 - Increase TSETTLE from 2 to 6 sec for VLBA based on
!                  experience with 7mm Phase referencing.  RCW
!  Apr. 26, 2002 - GBT slew rates.  Other GBT and Arec stuff changed
!                  earlier.  RCW
!  Feb. 22, 2003 - Accelerations.  Start Mark 5.
!  Apr. 03, 2003 - MINSETUP added.
!  Apr. 04, 2003 - VLBA TSETTLE reduced to 4 compensating for 
!                  acceleration time.
!  May. 04, 2004 - GBT TSETTLE set to 20 after BK100 experience.
!  Nov. 08, 2006 - Switching most stations to Mark5.
!  Dec. 04, 2006 - Add Westford.
!
