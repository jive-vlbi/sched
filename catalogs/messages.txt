                   SCHED MESSAGE FILE

This file contains messages that SCHED may wish to write to the
log file if something needs explanation.  Each message is preceeded
by a line starting with ++ and giving the message name.  A line 
starting with -- is not passed by SCHED to the log file.  It is
useful to record which subroutine requests the message.  The routine
WRTMSG reads this file and writes the message.

++eqep
--Called by SRREAD

You have used both EQUINOX and EPOCH in your source lists to set the
EQUINOX for precession.  EPOCH used to be used for this purpose, but
that is not really correct as became apparent when stellar proper
motions were introduced.  EQUINOX is now the proper veriable to use
for the purpose and the valid arguments are 'J2000', 'B1950', and
'DATE'.  SCHED tolerates the use of EPOCH for this purpose for 
backwards compatibility.  But if both are used, SCHED does not know
which to believe.  This can happen when you have some sources in a
SRCCAT section in the keyin input file and still use EPOCH while the
main source catalogs distributed with SCHED use EQUINOX.  Please
convert all source lists you are using to EQUINOX.

++expcode
--Called by CHKCODE

======================================================================
  WARNING   The project code (EXPCODE) for this observation has a 
            non-standard format.  Valid codes start with one or two 
            letters followed by 3 digits.  Any leading zeros should 
            be included.  A couple of valid examples are bt068 
            and v003.

            Note that some SCHED examples use non-valid codes, as do
            VLBA test observations.

++vlaflukephase
--Called by CHKVLA

======================================================================
  WARNING   The Fluke synthesizers at the VLA (pre EVLA) are used to 
            fine tune the VLA frequency.  They have the property that
            they do not necessarily return to the same phase if the
            frequency is set to something other than a multiple of
            10 MHz.  This is ok for the VLA because all antennas use
            the same Fluke signals.  But it will spoil phase coherence
            between scans for frequency switched VLBI (or EVLA) 
            observations.

            This schedule has setups with different VLA Fluke settings
            and at least one is not a multiple of 10 MHz.  Therefore
            you are at risk of random phase changes between scans for
            the VLA.  This may or may not be a problem depending on 
            the nature of the observations.  If you don't plan to carry
            phase between scans separated by scans at other frequencies,
            then there should not be a problem.  If you are doing some
            sort of combined frequency switching and phase referencing,
            then it won't work.

++scanremoval
--Called from AUTODOWN

  * Stations using automatic tape allocation or disk recording systems
    are being removed from scans when the source is below the antenna 
    pointing limits.  This behavior can be overridden using DODOWN.

++slewremoval
--Called from AUTODOWN

  * Some stations are unable to reach a scheduled source before the
    scan end time.  In most cases, those stations, if using disk 
    recordings, are being removed from the affected scans.  Usually
    the antenna is ready late because of a long slew, especially a
    cable wrap on alt/az antennas.  But it is also possible that
    other parameters that can delay a scan start time, such as 
    TLEVSET (time allowed for the first scan of a setup for digital
    backends to set levels), are playing a role.  Omission of an
    antenna in a scan for which it is not ready by the end can be 
    overridden using DODOWN, which is scan dependent.  Also using 
    DWELL time scheduling can prevent such cases.  With DWELL 
    with a second, but not a third argument, this may still happen 
    if there are slow antennas.

    Note that, if using DWELL with a second argument, the antenna
    that does not make it to source is counted as one of the ones
    not to wait for.  So don't be surprised if, for example, you
    specified not to wait for 2 and there is only one that gets there
    late.  There is likely to be another that was scheduled for the
    scan that has been removed for too long a slew.

    In cases where an antenna is removed from a scan for too long a
    slew, a "W" will be placed as the UP indicator.  That appears
    as a flag (along with "D", "H", "R", and "S") on some lines in
    the summary file scan listings.  It also appears in some cases
    in the sch file.

    Removing scans with too long slews is capable of creating an
    undesired situation when phase referencing.  When a wrap is
    needed, it is usually needed for one source before the other of
    a referencing pair.  With scan removal, this causes one of the
    sources to get skipped repeatedly until the second source needs
    the wrap, even though both sources would have been ok after 
    a wrap.  To try to avoid this syndrome, SCHED will not remove
    a station from a scan for too long slew if it is an ALTAZ 
    antenna and the slew is more than 315 degrees - ie it is a
    wrap.  

    Removing scans with too longs slews can have another bad effect
    when scheduling with DURATION.  If a long slew preceeds a series
    of short scans, it is possible to reject all of those short scans
    as each is rejected, causing the next to move up to where
    it will be rejected in turn.  Therefore SCHED detects when it
    it has emptied a scan of stations because of slews and, instead
    of skipping the scan as it would one with all antennas down, it
    reinstates all of the long-slew stations.  Those stations won't
    get to the source, but at least the next scan will be pushed out
    to where they will get to it.

    Be warned that, if your project can be time shifted as part of
    dynamic scheduling, incidents of problems with long slews 
    can affect different scans than those for which you tested the
    schedule.

++taperunning
--Called from SETTPS

Recording is being continued through short gaps between scans.
Add TPSTART to the SUMITEM list to see details.
MINPAUSE and PRESTART may be used to adjust this behavior.
Remember MINPAUSE is multiplied by the speed up factor, although
that factor is 1 for most modern systems.

++resync
--Called by CHKSCN

WARNING: More than 10% of the on-source, in-scan time in this schedule
will be lost to correlator resyncs at at least one station.
Correlator resyncs happen when the recordings stop and restart and
when certain reconfigurations happen.  The details vary according to
the recording system and the correlator.

You can easily have excessive sync losses at the VLBA correlator if
you stop the recording too often, such as between every scan in a phase
referencing observation.  If this is happening, investigate the
parameters PRESTART and MINPAUSE to try to keep the recordings moving
between scans, or at least to start them before the nominal scan start
time to allow for correlator sync.  MarkIV correlators are less
sensitive to recording stoppages and JIVE is somewhere in between.

For the VLBA recording system, a formatter reconfiguration causes a
constant time code to be sent to the recording for about 8 seconds.
This is treated as bad data at the correlator and delays
synchronization.  In fact, on the VLBA correlator, it seems to be
worse than having stopped the recording during the reconfigure.  It
typically adds 15 seconds to the resync - 8 for the period of bad time
and 7 more added to the typical resync time.  But for 10-20% of cases,
the resync takes much longer - up to about 80 seconds.  If you must
have a formatter reconfiguration, it is much better to do it while the
recording is stopped.  Just adding a GAP of 20 seconds or more should
do it.

On the VLBA correlator, a resync takes about 8, 13, or 25 seconds of
record time for speedup factors of 1, 2, or 4 for tape (about 8
seconds of playback time).  For disk, it is currently about 10 seconds
of record time longer than that, although we hope to bring that down
to much shorter values.  

At JIVE there is no speedup.  Tape resyncs take about 20 seconds and
disk about 1 second.  The tape value is reduced to about 10 seconds if
the scan gap is less than about 20 seconds.  Resyncs take longer,
20-30 seconds if there is a new configuration that requires a new
subjob.  The causes are basically the same as the causes of formatter
reconfigurations (see below), except there is no sensitivity to pcal
setups.

The MarkIV correlators take about 10s to sync with tape and of order a
second with disk.  Since each scan is handled independently, there is
no sensitivity to configuration, other than that they could not
correlate the period of bad time code produced during a
reconfiguration.

A common reason for excessive resyncs on the VLBA is unintended
formatter reconfigures.  Reconfigures are caused by changes in the
number of channels, the sample rate, the fanout, the format, the
barrel roll, the track assignments, the BBC sideband, the number of
bits, the BBC assignments, and the pcal detector setup.  Basically
they happen whenever the switching in the formatter must change.

One subtle cause of unintended reconfigures on VLBA systems is changes
to the pcal setup forced by frequency changes.  If the kHz digits of
the baseband frequency settings change, the tone detector frequencies
have to change which triggers a reconfigure.  If the MHz digits
change, no pcal change is needed because there is a tone every MHz.
For example, if a baseband is set to 635.49 in one setup and 862.99 in
another, a reconfigure will be triggered when switching between them.
If one is 635.49 and the other is 862.49, the pcal tone frequency will
be the same and there will not be a reconfigure despite the large
difference in the MHz part.  When band switching, always try to keep
the basic setup (number of channels, bits etc) the same and keep the
kHz digits of the frequencies the same.  

Another not-so-obvious cause for formatter reconfigures is changes to
the BBC sideband.  Recall on the VLBA that the IF is net upper
sideband for 6 cm and up but is lower sideband for the 20cm and 13cm
(S and L bands) systems.  Typical standard setups use net upper
sidebands.  For 20cm and 13cm, this requires a lower sideband mix at
the BBC. Different BBC sidebands are sent to different samplers and
hence require the formatter to reconfigure its input switches when
there is a change.  This issue can be avoided by switching to net
lower sideband for the 20cm and 13cm systems.

It should essentially never be necessary to provoke reconfigurations,
even when switching between observing bands.


++freqbw
--Called by CHKSC1

CAUTION: You have set FREQ and/or BW for some scans but have not
changed them when switching to a new setup file.  This might be
exactly what you intended, it would be wise to check to be sure.
These parameters do not change from scan to scan unless forced.  It is
possible that you really did want them to change, perhaps to the value
of the new setup file.  To cause SCHED to use the setup file value,
set FREQ=0 and/or BW=0.


++warn2cm
--Called by CHKSET

NOTE ABOUT 2CM FREQUENCIES: This message was triggered by your
observation with the legacy system near 15.3 GHz.  There is an
inconsistency between the frequencies specified in the standard setup
files and by a specification of BAND='2cm' in SCHED.  The standard
setup files use a center frequency of 15360.99.  This is also the
frequency at which the VLBA gains are measured.  The center frequency
used by SCHED for BAND='2cm' is 15285.49.  These frequencies are near
the edge of the "U" band at the VLA so it is likely that the lower
frequency was chosen for better VLA performance.  On the other hand,
the higher frequency is in a shared radio astronomy band (15.35-15.4
GHz) so is more protected.  One or the other could be changed so that
they match, but that has not been done in order to avoid a glitch in
on-going projects.  For most purposes, these two frequency settings
should be equivalent, but this message is provided to clarify the
situation, and to explain why the calibration gains might be for a
slightly different frequency than your observations.


++warnlong
--Called by CHKSCN

WARNING ABOUT LONG SCANS:  This schedule has some scans of more than
40 minutes duration.  Long scans have on occasion led to significant
data loss under various circumstances that shouldn't happen, but do.
For example, when a VLBA station has to change disk packs in the 
middle of a scan, there have been problems either getting all of that
station, or getting any calibration data for all other stations for
that scan.  We recommend keeping scans shorter than around 30 minutes.
If you want to stay on-source longer than that, multiple back-to-back
scans are likely to be safer than one long scan.  The final output
data will not be any different, at least on the VLBA.


++warn2phasemode
--Called by VLAPMODE

WARNING:  You have requested at least 2 VLA phasing modes (VA, VB,
VL, VR) for scans that use the same setup files.  This is unlikely
to be valid.  To change the IFs in use, different setup files are
needed and the different phasing modes phase different IFs.  SCHED
will also likely be prevented from being able to automatically set
the VLA setup parameters.


++multipleVLA
--Called by INVLA

WARNING:  You have more than one station that is the VLA (such as
VLA1 and VLA27).  You will only get crd, sch, and obs files for
one because they all have the same station code.  In most cases,
you only need to use one "station", such as "VLA" for the VLA even
if you are mixing phased array and single dish observations.

++CORAVGsetting1
--Called by CHKVDIFX

You have chosen to use the exact averaging time that you have
specified.  In that case, the DiFX software correlator will divide the
scan into bins of the exact length you have specified and average all
short term accumulations that fall within each bin, regardless of the
length of each short term accumulation which must be an integral times
the length of each input FFT.  The result is that each of your
integrations could have slightly different amounts of accumulated data
and a true mean time slightly offset from the nominal center recorded
as the time for the data point.  These effects only amount to a few
percent or less for normal data, but in extreme cases of narrow
bandwidths and many channels, can be more significant.

++CORAVGsetting2
--Called by CHKVDIFX

You have allowed the DiFX software correlator to adjust your average
time to be an integral number of input FFT intervals (and an integral
number of short-term accumulator intervals).  You did this by
specifying CORAVG without a second argument set to "EXACT".  What you
did is the default, and recommended, option.  The adjustment will be a
few percent or less in most cases, although it can get as high as
sqrt(2) for an extreme narrow bandwidth case with a large number of
spectral channels.

++CRD_RDBE_Warning
--Called by VLBASU

VLBASU: For stations using the RDBE, but also having old VLBA style
control systems (eg VLBA), crd files will be generated that may have
reduced channels and adjusted samplerate, frequencies and bandwidths
to conform to the capabilities of the old system.  These only affect
the old backend and recorder, not the new hardware.  They only affect
observations in that they will be used for reference pointing until
the new control system can point the antenna.  Also the system
temperatures and pulse cal information will be useful for monitoring
system health.  Note that, until Sept. 20, 2012, SCHED also set the
format to 'none', but it was then realized that this was not allowing
the formatter to be configured which prevented the pulse cal
detectors, which are in the formatter, from being set up properly.

++MismatchedSamprate
--Called by CHKSFIL

You have sample rates that don't match in different setup groups in
the same setup file.  Normally data recorded under all groups in a
setup file are correlated with each other.  This is impossible with
some correlators and requires special care with others.  With DiFX,
for example, it may be possible to mix sample rates (and bandwidths by
implication) to, for example, correlate several narrow baseband
channels against one wide one.  To do so requires the right relative
frequencies for all basebands and SCHED does not yet check to be sure
the setups are reasonable.  A case where such a mode might be used is
with the VLA at a required 128 MHz baseband bandwidth when it started
doing VLBI being correlated against 32 MHz channels from the RDBE_PFB
systems on the VLBA.  But this should be considered an untested mode
and is not really available for users except on the southern hemisphere 
LBA where it is the standard way of incorporating ASKAP.

When mixed sample rates, the options to use DOPPLER or FREQ to 
adjust the frequency from the schedule rather than the setup file
will be blocked.  Those inputs assume all stations have the same
channel structure which will not be true with mixed sample rates.

++Level_Settings
--Called by RDBELEVT

The RDBE and the WIDAR have to set signal power levels in at least two
places.  Prior to the samplers, the analog power level is set.
Changes can cause changes in phase and the sampler, with many bits,
has a lot of headroom, so this is only done once per project for each
setup configuration that affects the IF (it is not done for minor
baseband frequency changes within an IF such as occur with Doppler
tracking, at least on the VLBA).  Five seconds should be allowed for
this process on the VLBA, which normally won't be a probem.  Sixty
seconds are needed on the VLA.  The antenna catalog input TLEVSET is
used to try to enforce such a gap for the first scan of each setup.

The second level setting operation occurs at the start of every scan
for the RDBE/PFB and involves the thresholds for high and low states
of the 4 level/2 bit samples that are recorded.  Two seconds should be
allowed for that, which will normally be provided automatically thanks
to TSETTLE.  Again, when the on-line system is given an inadequate
gap, the beginning of the scan will be corrupted.  Flags will
eventually be written, but are not yet.  SCHED will warn when it sees
a scan gap shorter than that for the first time.  The antenna catalog
parameter MINSETUP should be long enough to include this time.

The gap of interest is between the stop time of the previous scan at
the station and the time when recording of data would start.  With the
RDBE/MARK5C system, the recording starts when the good data is
expected to start.  In the VEX file, that is the "start" time plus the
station dependent start time offset in the $SCHED section.  The
"start" time is the nominal scan start time minus the offset for
starting the "tape" requested using PRESTART and MINPAUSE.

For the VLBA, information about the first incidence of a recording
stop of less than 5 seconds with a first setup encounter or 2 seconds
with no setup change is below.

++harmwarn
--Called by HARMWARN

Internally generated RFI tones can result from mixing of harmonics of
the front-end synthesizers on the VLBA.  Under some circumstances,
these tones can have very high amplitudes and cause ringing across the
band.  In other circumstances, they are not actually seen.  An
exhaustive study of when they are a problem has not been made.  They
are known to be an issue with the new 6cm system when two different
LOs are used to get observations at well separated RF frequencies.
Spot checks for 13cm/4cm and 1cm observations suggest that they might
not actually be a problem there.  The tones are likely to be strongest
with lower harmonics with the worst case being when the fundamental
output of one synthesizer is in the observing band for another.

Any pair of the 3 synthesizers can be involved.  Also, the oscillator
frequency for synthesizer outputs above 8.0 GHz is actually at half
the output freqeuncy, so one needs to worry about harmonics of that
half frequency.  

Some of the synthesizer frequencies will be forced by the science.
But the unused synthesizers can be set at any valid set point and that
choice matters.  SCHED can do fairly well at picking benign settings
so it is recommended to let SCHED make the choice.  SCHED warns when
the specified synthesizer frequencies could cause problems.  You are
seeing this message because SCHED has detected one or more cases in
your setups where harmonics of the LO settings can mix and produce a
tone in your IF bands.  This does not mean that there will be a signal
there for sure, just that it is possible.  Also, such tones are
normally only a problem if they fall within a baseband, so the
warnings below indicate if that is the case, at least if you have not
changed the frequenies from the setup file values using Doppler or
in-line frequency specification.  You probably only need to worry if
there is a 'yes' in the last column.

If you get this warning and have forced the unused synthesizer
frequencies, you should change that and let SCHED pick the
frequencies.  Or you can try other settings.  Sometimes a specific RF
frequency can be observed with more than one setting of the
synthesizers.  Check the freq.dat table for alternatives and, if there
are some, try forcing them.  If your science can tolerate slightly
different frequencies, such as when obtaining wide spanned bandwidth
with observations at opposite ends of the receiver range, you might be
able to move the chosen bands to allow use of a different synthesizer
setting.  Perhaps the easiest thing to do in most cases is to shift
your baseband frequecies so that the tone, while still in the IF, is
not in one of the basebands.


++harmwarnold
--Called by HARMWARN  (Old version kept because of extra info).

Internally generated RFI tones can result from mixing of harmonics of
the front-end synthesizers on the VLBA.  Under some circumstances,
these tones can have amplitudes of several hundred in the
autocorrelations as measured using a 32 MHz baseband bandwidth and
31.25 kHz spectral channel bandwidth.  Such tones cause very strong
ringing across the autocorrelation spectrum without smoothing.  They
are also seen, more weakly, in the cross-correlations because of the
concentration of power in the affected channel.  All three of the
synthesizers are involved in producing these tones whether or not they
are actually in use.  So it matters how all synthesizers are set, not
just the active ones.

The tones are strongest when the frequencies that mix include the
nominal output frequency of one of the synthesizers.  They are also
strongest, at least for the 4-8 GHz "6cm" receiver when the
synthesizers are numbers 1 and 2, both of which feed the IF converter.
Other harmonics, and synthesizer 3, which usually is used for the high
frequency front ends, create tones that are much weaker.  

A complication is that, above 8.0 GHz, the synthesizer's main
oscillator is running at half the output frequency and a doubler
produces the final output.  A birdy is seen at harmonics of the 
half frequency.

SCHED tries to warn of choices of front end frequencies (often
obtained from the freq.dat file) that could cause problems.  When
SCHED is allowed to choose the frequencies of the unused synthesizers
(Setup parameter SYNTH not set for the unused synthesizers), it will
try exhaustively to find benign frequencies and it should be able to
in essentially all cases.  So it is best to let SCHED choose.

Any bands can be affected if the user sets the unused synthesizers to
unfortunate frequencies.  For any case where only one synthesizer is 
in use, benign settings can be found for the others and SCHED will
find those if the settings are not forced with the SYNTH parameter.
This includes most observations below 16 GHz.  If 2 or more synthesizers
have their frequencies forced by the requested RF frequencies, there
can be issues.  This can happen with dual IF observations with the
new 6cm receiver, dual band S/X observations, the wideband X band option
that uses 2 synthesizers (or 3 if it is combined with S/X), and with
all observations about 20 GHz which require a signal for the mix in
the front end.

You are getting this message because your setup has a combination of
front end settings that could cause this sort of internal RFI in
your IF.  Such tones are normally only a problem if they fall within
a baseband, so the warnings below indicate if that is the case.  You
probably only need to worry if there is a 'yes' in the last column.

If you get this warning and have forced the unused synthesizer
frequencies, you should change that and let SCHED pick the
frequencies.  Or you can try other settings.  Sometimes a specific RF
frequency can be observed with more than one setting of the
synthesizers.  Check the freq.dat table for alternatives and, if there
are some, try forcing them.  If your science can tolerate slightly
different frequencies, such as then obtaining wide spanned bandwidth
with observations at opposite ends of the receiver range, you might be
able to move the chosen bands to allow use of a different synthesizer
setting.  Perhaps the easiest thing to do in most cases is to shift
your baseband frequecies so that the tone, while still in the IF, is
not in the baseband.




++overlap_scans
--Called by CHKSCN

Some previous generation correlators used information from the 
observing logs to determine what antennas to correlate together.  
SCHED supports modes that allow different antennas to be scheduled
in different SCHED scans even when they are meant to be cross
correlated.  The VEX driven correlators, including DiFX (the current
VLBA correlator), do not support this scheduling style.  All antennas
to be correlated must be specified in the same SCHED scan.  

You are seeing this message because SCHED has found two scans that
look like they might be intended to be correlated together.  They have
different antennas, but overlap in time, frequency, and source.  SCHED
has not done an exhaustive check of the setup channels so it is still
possible that they are different - but the frequency range overlaps.
If the scans were not intended to be correlated together, ignore the
warnings.  But if they were, you should combine the scans into one
or more that include all the stations.

   
++VXDISK
--Called from VXWRT (obsolete)

                    -----------  WARNING  -----------
You have specified DISK in the TAPEINI section for one or more stations. This
VEX file can not be processed at the current time (2004 Jan 7). You must
schedule for tapes to produce a valid VEX file. For testing purposes *ONLY*,
parameter VEXTEST may be specified in the key file. Observations not requiring
a VEX file (e.g. VLBA correlated in Socorro) should *not* specify parameter
DOVEX in the key file.

++astropatch
--Called from CHK4DAR

The frequency setup you have specified is not allowed for a MkIV station.
Astronomical patching at MkIV stations is restricted such that odd numbered
BBCs can only receive signal from IF channels 1N and 2A, and even numbered BBCs
receive signal from IF channels 2N and 1A (also every setup must use at least
one of either 1N or 2N). Probably you have specified an 'IFCHAN', or you have
specified a 'BBC' and 'POL' combination that is incompatible with this. Try
using SCHED defaults instead of explicit setting of 'IFCHAN' or 'BBC'.

++freepatch
--Called from CHK4DAR

You have specified 'free' patching for a telescope with a Mk4 rack. This means
that you have bypassed all checks on the patching of the Mk4 rack. This mode is
intended for testing by MkIV experts only. The resulting schedule will almost
certainly not run on any standard telescope. Do not do this unless you are
absolutely sure of what you are doing.

++geopatch
--Called from CHK4DAR
You have specified geodetic patching (M4PATCH='GEO1') for one or more
telescopes. SCHED does not have a comprehensive model for geodetic patching,
but it appears that your requested frequency setup does not conform to the
normal geodetic station setup which has the following patching for each BBC
(VC):

BBC 1-2    IF1N low
BBC 3      IF1N high/low
BBC 4      IF1N high
BBC 5-8    IF1N high or IF3N high or IF3O high
BBC 9      IF2N low
BBC 10     IF2N high/low
BBC 11-14  IF2N high

low means that the top frequency of the BBC must be below 230 MHz, high means
that the bottom frequency of the BBC must be above 210 MHz.

Please check your settings for 'IFCHAN' and 'BBC' and your BBC frequencies.
Note that use of geodetic patching in SCHED is experimental.

++slowdatarate
--Called from CHK4REC
--Called from CHKJIVE

You have requested a track bit rate below 4 Mb/s/track. This is not permitted
for recordings going to the EVN correlator at JIVE. If this experiment is going
to JIVE you can increase the track bit rate by either increasing the total data
rate or decreasing the fanout of the recording.

++barrelroll
--Called from CHKJIVE

You have requested barrel rolling. This is not possible for the JIVE correlator
at the current time. It is allowed for experiments to be correlated in Socorro
or Bonn. Testers *only* may specify MODETEST.

++ftpgap
--Called from VXSCH

You have requested an ftp (GRAB) scan. In order to copy the data from the Mk5A
disk to the system disk you must leave a gap before the next scan so that this
can be done before the next scan begins. The minimum safe gap, based on the
amount of data you have requested to transfer, is given in the messages above.

++oversamp
--Called from CHKJIVE
One or more of the channels in one or more of your setups uses oversampling.
Experiments going to the EVN correlator at JIVE may use a maximum oversampling
factor of 4. Higher oversampling factors cannot be correlated.

++tsysgap 
--Called from VXSCH 
For most MkIV stations (e.g. most of the EVN) the calibration diode is
only fired during gaps in recording. Although the total power is
monitored continuously during scans, the calibration diode must be
fired regularly to allow these total power levels to be accurately
converted to system temperatures. It is recommended that, where
possible, you leave a gap in recording at least every 15 minutes to
allow the system temperature measurements. The gap should be at least
15 seconds, but you should also try to ensure that these gaps are long
enough that all the antennas are on source before the next scan
starts. Note that warnings about Westerbork and Arecibo can be safely
ignored because they have continuous system temperature measurements.

++tsysoffsrc
--Called from VXSCH
Note that although you may have left gaps during which the system temperature
can be measured at MkIV stations, one or more stations are still slewing at the
scan starts. System temperatures measured when the antennas are slewing are
unlikely to be useful. The time between useful Tsys measurements is therefore
likely to be longer than the recommended 15 minutes at the stations listed
above. Note that warnings about Westerbork and Arecibo can be safely ignored.

++warnbank
-- Called from VXSCH
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SEVERE WARNING
You have insufficient gaps in your schedule. Do NOT ignore this message unless
you are sure there will be no media changes or electronic transfer of your
data.

The problem is that one or more of your field system controlled
stations has continuous recording for longer than recommended. At
field system stations disk packs can only be changed during gaps in
recording. Also, long continuous recording leads to very large Mark5 files
which are difficult to transfer electronically. Gaps of more than 10 seconds
should be inserted every 22 mins at 2 Gbps (less often at lower rates).  Please
add some gaps to your schedule!  See sched.runlog for a list of affected scans
(may appear well before this message).  
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
