!  FREQUENCY CATALOG for SCHED
!  This version does not include most VLBA settings as those area
!  generated by SCHED now.
!
!  The version is set up for the 512-1024 MHz IF range of the RDBE
!  system.  The rf ranges are slightly offset from the original
!  freq.dat.

!  This file gives a selection of possible frequency setups for
!  many active VLBI stations.  For the VLBA, the selection is
!  basicaly complete - nearly all valid setups are included.  For
!  other stations, many of the frequently used setups are included.
!  SCHED can use this file to find the appropriate LO and IF settings
!  given the desired observing frequencies.  The user should not
!  need to know the hardware setups at the various stations.  In 
!  fact, users should avoid making their own frequency setups if
!  possible.  If the desired frequency is in this file, it won't 
!  be necessary to bother the station friends for information.  And
!  this file is kept reasonably up to date so it should be trusted
!  more than information in old schedules.
!
!  SCHED will also use this file to check against any user generated
!  setups.  If the user setup does not match one here, warnings will
!  be issued as a flag that the user should make doubly sure that 
!  the setup is ok.
!
!  The input parameters are:
!     STATION   Stations covered by this group.
!     PRIOrity  Lower values are favored groups.
!     RF1       Lower limit of RF frequencies covered by this group.
!     RF2       Upper RF limit.
!     POL       Polarization of this IF.
!     LO1       The sum of all LOs other than the BBC.
!     IFNAME    The name of the IF as used by control software.
!     FE        The front end name (mainly VLBA).
!     SYN       The 3 VLBA front end synthesizer settings.
!     DUALX     Use the wide band X band system on the VLBA.
!     CH1RF1    Lower hard RF limit for channel 1.  Mainly for 2cm VLBA.
!     CH1RF2    Upper hard RF limit for channel 1.  These select filter.
!     RCP50CM, LCP50CM  50 cm VLBA filter (NARROW or BROAD)
!
!  VLA specific items.  For the meaning of most, see the SCHED manual.
!     CHNSTA    Used to show if IF is phased array or single dish. (obsolete)
!     VLABAND, VLABW, VLAFEAB, VLAFECD, VLASYNA, VLASYNB, FLUKEA, FLUKEB
!
!
!  For each of the VLBA bands, a summary of significant filters and 
!  LO's is given in the comments.
!  Receiver and filter ranges are to nominal 1/2 power points.
!  The "maximum range" and "good range" are taken from examination of
!  plots of measured data in VLBA Test Memo 51.  These are subjective, 
!  eyeball estimates.  Anyone attempting to schedule near the limits 
!  should look at Memo 51.

!                 Using extra IF's because the receiver can be called

!
!                 There is no change here for the RDBE  because all

!              All stations except MK, PT, and FD have a 2200-2400

!   1 cm     -  At 1 cm, are two synthesizers and many combinations,
!               some of which give the same frequency.
!           First LO filter:     12000 - 14500
!           First IF filter:      9300 - 10200
!           Second LO filter:     7150 -  9650

!           Good range:          21400 - 24300
!           Maximum 2-16 GHz synthesizer setting is 15.9 (16.1?) GHz.
!        Reasonable second LO's that pass full 500 MHz bands of the
!        right sideband are: 8.9 and 9.1 GHz.  Anything else has
!        the potential to loose signal at the first IF filter.
!        However, a lower LO might be needed to reach extreme 
!        frequencies.
!
!        Naming convention.
!          eg v1cm_a3  The last 2 letters according to:
!            Syn(1) = 8.6 (x), 8.9 (a), 9.1 (b), 9.4 (c)
!            Syn(3) = 11.4 (-1), 11.6 (0), 11.9 (1), 12.1 (2), 12.4 (3),

!  VLBA  7mm   The first LO is Syn(3) * 3.  The second is Syn(2)
!          Receiver nominal:              40.0 - 45.0  GHz
!          LO filter before 3X multiply: 10.75 - 12.25 
!          First IF filter:               7.70 - 9.10  
!          First IF filter:               7.90 - 8.90  (KP, FD)
!          Second LO filter:              7.15 - 9.65  
!          Maximum range:                 37.6 - 46.2 
!          Good range:                    39.2 - 45.2 
!     Upper and lower sidebands at the second mix could be used.
!     The on-line system did not originally support lower sidebands,
!     but supposedly it does now.
!     Possible second synthesizer settings:
!          7.4, 7.6       Good.
!          9.4, 9.6       Good.
!
!     The following are possible, but are not used in the setups.
!          7.1 GHz        IF will cut off below 600 MHz.  Is used
!                           in some projects.
!          7.9            Probably good.  LO in IF band.
!          8.1            Risk getting some lower sideband.
!
!     Give the 9.4 and 9.6 second LO options lower priority
!     because they give lower sideband mixes.  This should be ok
!     now (wasn't for a while), but is not all that well tested.
!
!     Naming conventions:  eg v7mm_b3
!        syn(2) = 7.1 (a), 7.4 (b), 7.6 (c), 7.9 (d), 8.1 (e),
!                 9.1 (f), 9.4 (g), 9.6 (h), 9.9 (i)
!        syn(3) = 9.9 (1), 10.1 (2), 10.4 (3), 10.6 (4), 10.9 (5),

! VLBA at 3mm

!     The nominal band for the 86 GHz receiver is 80-96 GHz.  The
!     RF is mixed in the receiver with an LO that is synthesizer 3
!     multiplied by 6.  The intermediate IF thus generated is sent
!     to the 2 cm IF converter where it can pass through any of the
!     4 filters (Clark, 2004mar01).  Care should be taken to not 
!     be on the boundaries between those filters.
!
!     Keep Synthesizer 3 in range 10.9 to 13.6 (Hayward, Mar. 1, 
!     2004).  Hayward suggests picking a first IF close to 14.2 GHz.
!
!     The 2 cm IF converter filter is chosen based on the intermediate
!     IF frequency of the first channel in the same manner as for 2 cm.  
!     See the description of the 2 cm system above for details.
!
!     By leaving out the second LO (synthesizer 1) settings that 
!     have IF's that cross the filter boundaries, we avoid 
!     confusion and insure full 500 MHz bands all the time.  This 
!     means leaving out the N.1 (where N is 12, 13, or 14) MHz LO 
!     settings.  We are left with a good set of allowed settings 
!     that allow any frequency to be reached.  The set below has
!     had the duplicates removed, favoring sets with the IF near
!     14.2 GHz.  Also the RF ranges are restricted to fall in the
!     range 79.7 to 96.2 GHz.
!
!     The 2cm converter covers:
!          Max range:   11800 - 15700
!          Good range:  12100 - 15500
!          Allowed LO settings:   11.1 - 14.9
!          Used settings: 11.9, 12.4, 12.6, 12.9, 
!                         13.4, 13.6, 13.9, 14.4
!     Recommended values of syn(3):
!         10.9, 11.1, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9, 12.1,
!         12.4, 12.6, 12.9, 13.1, 13.4, 13.6
!     After 6X multiple, the 0.3 GHz gaps become 1.8 GHz.
!
!
!  Here is the old "standard" setup (Pre 2004mar01).  It turns out 
!  not to be very good because the IF is at the edge of a 2cm IF 
!  converter filter.  The 500 MHz IF was in 14600-15100 which should
!  work for most cases, but could lose the top 100 MHz in a spread
!  IF case.

!     Aug. 15, 2011  Added the K band multi-beam receiver.  RCW.

!     For most bands, this is just using N*500+-100, or the corresponding
!     restrictions for 2 LO systems.
!     For cases where the VLBA and GBT use opposite sidebands, the
!     GBT LO is set offset by 1024+512=1536 MHz from the corresponding
!     VLBA LO.  That way, the 512 MHz bands match.  For the PFB
!     personality, DiFX can invert sidebands so, if the RF frequencies
!     match, they can be correlated.  SCHED will be taught to 
!     recognize this.  Oct 11, 2011  RCW

!  GBT based on web site on 8Dec2000 RCW.
!  Revised 27Apr2002 FDG
!  IF3 (=BBC) = LO1 - LO2 + LO3 - Fsky for X band and down.
!  FIRSTLO ('lo1' in file below) = LO1 - LO2 + LO3;  Fsky + 0.75GHz = lo1
!  IF3 (=BBC) = Fsky - LO1 - LO2 + LO3 at higher frequencies.
!  FIRSTLO ('lo1' in file below) = LO1 + LO2 - LO3;  Fsky - 0.75GHz = lo1
!  All GBT setups have LO3=10.5 GHz, IF3 = 0.75 GHz, and IF2 = 9.75 GHz.

!
!  90cm will still have 500 MHz added on the VLBA, not 512.
!  So the full IF (mostly empty) corresponds to 12-524 MHz RF.
!  The GBT then needs to be at 524+512=1036 MHz to get the
!  same RF range.

!   Frank:  I have made 3 X band setups because 800 MHz
!   is too wide for the 500 MHz VLBA backend IF.  I have
!   arbitrarily set the ranges to match the VLBA settings.
!   That simplifies matters for anyone trying to maximize
!   their instantaneous bandwidth.
!---------------------------------------------------------
! Note: X-band range is 7.9 - 11.6 GHz
!      more setups could be added
! The VLBA can match first LOs at 9100 and 9400, but prefers
! upper sideband low in the range.  If the VLBA is using
! upper sideband and the GBT lower, a match requires adding 
! 36 MHz to the GBT frequencies.  SCHED is reluctant to span 
! crossover frequencies, which will be different between the
! choices, so that should drive it to select the right set.

! The GBT receiver has 4 overlapping bands
!   68-74 GHz  FL1 upper sideband;   lo1 = sky frequency - 750 MHz
!   73-80 GHz  FL2 lower sideband;   lo1 = sky frequency + 750 MHz
!   79-86 GHz  FL3 upper sideband;   lo1 = sky frequency - 750 MHz
!   85-92 GHz  FL4 upper sideband;   lo1 = sky frequency - 750 MHz
!
! Beam 1 connects to DAR inputs A and C
! Beam 2 connects to DAR inputs B and D
!
!  I am told the Tsys on beam 2 is slightly better, so ifname=B,D is used here.

! The following is the Freq.dat file for Arecibo LBW, S-Radar, C-band
! Tapasi Ghosh, 8 October 2001
!
! Adding X-band and S-low and S-High today. TG, 26 April 2002
!
! Adding 610 MHz and C-High, CJS, 15 May 2006
!
! Also modifying LBW, S-Low, S-High, C-band and X-band to avoid the loss
! of correlation for i.f. frequencies below 600 MHz. Should be good for
! up to 2 GBps recording. Sideband swap for X-band Rx above 8.5 GHz
! taken into acocunt -- hopefully! CJS, 15 May 2006
! 
! Removing S2  July 22, 2010  RCW.
