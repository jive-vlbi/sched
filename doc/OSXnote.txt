This is an announcement that SCHED can be run on Mac OS X systems.

I recently installed SCHED on a Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) system (iBook
G4).  To do so, you need a fortran compiler and, for the plot stuff,
pgplot.  I got gcc by installing the Xcode package that was already on
disk but not installed (see installers under applications).  The X
windows package is not on disk, but is on the third OS X installation
disk (not the second as it says in some documentation).  The FORTRAN
compiler, g77, is not included with gcc for some reason so you have to
get it elsewhere.  A binary based on the gcc that comes with OS X 10.3
is available at http://hpc.sourceforge.net (g77 3.4).  It unpacked
itself on download and basically just worked.  I understand from the
AIPS group that the IBM compiler mentioned at the same site probably
would provide significantly better performance, but that is not much
of an issue for SCHED.  Note that earlier versions of OS X might 
require more work to set up the compiler.

I see that PGPLOT is one of the packages available through fink 
(http://fink.sourceforge.net), although I downloaded it from Caltech
and built it.  I started with the bsd g77_gcc .conf file with the 
following changes:
 FFLAGD="-fno-backslash"
 LIBS="-L/usr/lib -lgcc -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11"
I had some problems with the fonts, but reruns of pgpack eventually
cleared them up.

Once f77 and pgplot were available, installing SCHED was a matter
of getting the right set of compiler switches in the Makefile.
No code changes were required.  You could easily do this with the
current (2003sep18) released version of Sched.

In the makefile, set (yes, mostly the LINUX settings work!):
ARCH = LINUX
FC = g77 -Wall -Wimplicit -fno-backslash # g77 (Linux, OS X and others)
XLD = -L/usr/lib -lgcc -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 # Mac OS X (ie DARWIN)
LPGPLOT = /usr/local/pgplot
LDPGPLOT = -L$(LPGPLOT) -lpgplot                 # Not Hp - link lib.

The location of the libraries may vary if you install them differently
from what I did - like if you use fink.

I discovered while doing this that the plot stub option does not
work.  Without thinking about it, I had put some plot routines related
to configuration searches outside the stubbed directory so it still
wanted PGPLOT.  That has been fixed in the development version.
From the lack of complaints, I take it that no one is installing without 
pgplot, which is good.

Cheers,
