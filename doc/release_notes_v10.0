SCHED version 10.0 is now available as of Sept. 19, 2011.  This
release is happening at this time to make the PREEMPT parameter
available to users before the USNO daily EOP runs begin.  Those runs
will take the Pie Town and Mauna Kea VLBA antennas for about 1.5 hr
every day as is being announced in a separate email.  There is some
flexibility in the exact time that will be preempted at those two
stations and the PREEMPT keyword allows the user to give the
schedulers guidance on which scans can be preempted and which should
be protected.  See the manual discussion of PREEMPT for more details.
The EOP observations will begin at the beginning of October, 2011.

While the timing of this release is driven by the EOP observations, a
number of other changes, additions, and bug fixes have occurred since
the 9.4 release.  All are noted in the manual in the section about
this release.  In addition to code changes, there has been progress on
including PGPLOT with SCHED.  This is being done because dealing with
PGPLOT seems to be the cause of many SCHED installation issues.  Also,
migration to GFORTRAN from G77 as the main compiler is well along, but
not complete.  More changes are expected in the near future, especially
in support of new hardware on both the EVN and VLBA.  So if you don't
have a project to schedule immediately, and don't need to resubmit
files with PREEMPT, then it might be worth waiting for v10.1.  Note 
that the source and locations catalogs have not been updated.  That
will happen with the next release.

This release is now the standard version in /usr/local in Socorro.
The tar files with the code and the binary executables can be found at
ftp.aoc.nrao.edu in pub/sched/sched_10.0 and the binaries subdirectory
therein.  The SCHED manual is at
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/software/sched/index.html 

There is new information concerning the preemption of MK and PT for
the EOP runs and on scheduling 24 hour runs in INFORMATION AND ADVICE
ON SPECIFIC TOPICS under Scheduling Tips.  Details about the use of
PREEMPT can be found by following the links: THE SCHED INPUT FILES ---
The Schedule File --- PREEMPT.  The use of PREEMPT is demonstrated in
the egdelzn.key example.  The use of comments to guide the dynamic
schedulers in wrapping 24 hour files is demonstrated in the new
example eg24.key.

Note that the binary for OSX_INTEL uses PGPLOT libraries that are
in $SCHED/lib/OSX_INTEL.

Cheers,
