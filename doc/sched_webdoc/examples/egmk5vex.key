! This example is for an EVN Mark5 observation.
! Warning - this has a vlba station using MARK5A.  That is no longer
! possible.


! A special station catalog was used originally because Mark5 was not
! really available in VEX at first.  But now the standard catalogs
! are used.

! This started out as an early Mark5 test and used the TAPEINI
! section to set the media to disk at a few sites.  Disk is now
! standard and the TAPEINI sections are no longer supported, so
! it is now just another example of a valid schedule.
