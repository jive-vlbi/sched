!  Example sched input file for VLBA observations at 3mm.
!  WARNING - this file uses a setup appropriate for MARK5A 
!  recordings which is very low bit rate compared to what
!  is now normal.  The RDBE_DDC can do it, but you probably
!  want more bandwidth.  eg3mmb.key and eg3mm_rd2.key show
!  2 Gbps setups with the DDC and PFB.

!  This example differs from the other 3mm examples mainly
!  because it explicitly sets the reference pointing scans
!  rather than using the automatic insertion of such scans.
!  It also uses a setup similar to that used for the 
!  observing setup for the pointing scans rather than using 
!  one of the usual pointing setups used in the other examples.
!  That may have once been a good idea, but is no longer 
!  really needed.

! ===============  A Note on Reference Pointing  ===========
! ==========================================================
!  Sched now always puts any reference pointing inside the
!  scan where it is requested.  The VLBA on-line system will not
!  begin the pointing sequence until the antenna is on source,
!  but if it has to wait more than about 40 seconds, it will
!  give up.  Therefore, when explicitly specifying reference
!  pointing scans, it is good to use dwell, or at least specify
!  a gap long enough for the antenna to reach the source.  The
!  pointing scan should have about 60 seconds of on-source 
!  time to do the pointing.
!
!  This example shows full explicit insertion of reference pointing
!  scans.  See the other eg3mm examples for use of the automatic
!  insertion of scans, or at least automatic conversion of specified
!  scans to pointing.

! ========================  The Scans  =====================
! ==========================================================


!
!   Note that this schedules GAP and DUR.  That will not 
!   be optimal for most cases.  Consider using DWELL.



pcal=OFF              !  No useful PCAL is available at 3 mm.

!  Start with a fringe finding scan on 3C273 with reference
!  pointing on itself at 7mm (might need to use a line source).
!  See the SGRA loop below for details of what each scan is doing.
!  BW=0 invokes the setup file bandwidth.  Would be needed later in 
!  schedule, but not strictly necessary here.
!  Note if more than one BW is ever set explicitly to a non-zero 
!  value, those same channels must be set explicitly again next
!  time there is a change.  It is probably best to either only
!  every give one value, or always specify all channels explicitly.

!  Now get to the vicinity of the main program source with a dummy 
!  (norecord and nopeak) scan.  This could be done with a gap in
!  the first scan, below, but then that can could not be in the loop.

!   MAIN OBSERVING:  3 scans in a loop. 
!     A: First is for reference pointing.  No tape recording.
!        Assume slew less than 40 sec and allow time for slew and pointing
!        Use a 7mm setup like the 3mm setup to allow step B.  
!        Otherwise could use the simple peaking setup.
!     B: Second helps confirm pointing from an autocorrelation.
!        This is not required, but it could be useful to assist calibration.
!        If the maser source has a 3mm line, consider looking at that.
!     C: Third is the VLBI observing scan.

!     BEGIN LOOP
group=3 repeat=25     !  Loop through following 3 scans 25 times.

!     A: Reference pointing.
!        It used to be possible to drop the bandwidth but keep the rest
!        of the setup.  But the DiFX (and RDBE?) cannot oversample, so
!        use a setup with 2 MHz channels.  Also use only 4 channels.
