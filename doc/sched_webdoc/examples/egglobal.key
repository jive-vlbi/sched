!  Example sched input for a global VLBI observation.
!  This is for the legacy Mark5A system, not the new wideband
!  systems.  MARK5A recordings are no longer possible on the VLBA
!  this file needs to be updated.
!
!  VLA removed - no legacy capability and the setups violate
!  the constraints of the WIDAR phased array setup.  Nov. 1, 2012. RCW.
!
!  EB_VLBA changed to EFLSBERG Nov. 13, 2013.  RCW.  EB_VLBA has the
!  RDBE_DDC tuning constraints and this is an old systems schedule
!  with a .49 MHz tuning point.  The DBBC can do it.

 coverlet /

Between the line that has 'coverlet' and '/' on it, and ending
with the line that has 'endcover' and a slash, you can put any
text you want.  The lines can be up to 256 characters long
but should be less than 80 to look reasonable in the output
files.  There is no restriction on the characters to use,
but just don't have both 'endcover' and a slash on the same line
until you are really done.  The space would be used for special
instructions to stations that are normally manned and is meant
to take the place of the separate files often provided by PI's.
