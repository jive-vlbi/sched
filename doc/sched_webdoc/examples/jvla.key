!  jvla.key
!
!  This is a file to schedule a VLBI observation on the VLA
!  and VLBA.  It uses the WIDER correlator to provide phased
!  array output on the VLA.
!
!  This file started from early testing of the JVLA capability
!  for VLBI.  It will likely evolve fairly rapidly.
!  It was first set up as an example on May 23, 2012.  RCW.
!  Modified for more chance of success in actual observing on
!  Oct. 27, 2012 - mainly by matching bandwidths.  It uses
!  32 MHz channels from the WIDAR to match 4 of the 16 PFB
!  outputs from the RDBE on the VLBA.  There will be another
!  example of use with the DDC.

!  Change to 1 MHz pcal  July 7, 2014

! ==================== Setup Information ===================
! ==========================================================
!  This setup uses the RDBE with the PFB personality on the VLBA
!  with 16 by 32 MHz channels.  If the mixed bandwidth mode on
!  DiFX is activated, the VLA could match the bandwidth with 
!  four 128 MHz basebands.  But for now, we must use matched 
!  bandwidths and a maximum of 4 channels for a total of
!  only 128 MHz and 512 Mbps from the VLA.  The sideband 
!  must be upper, so use a high side LO on the VLBA to counter 
!  the required LSB baseband channels from the PFB.  Here we target
!  the old 6cm standard of 4990 MHz which can be reached with an
!  LO of 5600 on the VLBA.  An LO of 5900 would also do it, but 
!  would put 4990 in a crossover region.  Normally a low LO (maybe
!  4100 or 4400) would be used on the VLBA, but that would not 
!  allow matched sidebands.

!  Aug. 7, 2014:  Something was only done partially at some point and 
!  the frequencies specified were below the 4990 range.  Perhaps the 
!  BBCs were originally set for a 5900 MHz first LO and then not changed
!  when going to 5600.  This resulted in 4990, the old standard frequency,
!  and the one at which gains are measured, being above all basebands.  
!  With 5900 MHz first LO, 4990 would have an IF frequency of 910 MHz 
!  which is near the center of the bands chosen.  Today I shifted
!  to use the 5900 MHz LO and keep the original bbsyn settings.
!  I also had to change the order of the VLA channels to keep ascending
!  frequency order.  Not sure what happened there either.

!  For possible future use - all PFB basebands in the two posible orders
!  (only half of the frequencies can be used with dual polarization):
!  bbsyn    = 528.0, 528.0, 560.0,  560.0, 592.0,  592.0,  624.0,  624.0,
