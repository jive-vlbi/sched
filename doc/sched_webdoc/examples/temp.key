!  Example of a "piggyback" observation using both Mark5A and
!  Mark5C (RDBE_PFB) recordings.
!
!  This is no longer very useful as the MARK5A units are no longer
!  at most VLBA stations.
!
!  The version of the RDBE PFB firmware available at the time 
!  had a fixed arrangement of basebands. See more details with
!  the setups.
!
!  For the test project from which this file was adapted
!  the old VLBA DAR and Mark5A recorder were run in
!  parallel with the RDBE/MARK5C system.  For that situation,
!  SCHED must be run twice.  One pass produces the control
!  files for the old system and for correlation of the data
!  from that system.  The second pass produces the 
!  control file for the new system and for correlation of the
!  data from the new system.  SCHED does not have the 
!  ability to produce all the files at once with full user
!  control because many  variables that are reused need 
!  different values.  For MARK5C schedules, SCHED will provide
!  default setups for the legacy hardware, but will not activate
!  recording.
!
!  Setup files are here for both VLBA/Mark5A recordings and 
!  RDBE/Mark5C recordings.  Some show nearly all parameters
!  specified.  Some show the use of SCHED's defaulting
!  capabilities.
!  
!  For the two passes for different systems, not all of the 
!  inputs are the same.  Where there are differences, the lines
!  start with "!MARK5A" or "".  The "!" makes the line
!  a comment so it is ignored by SCHED.  Those identifiers
!  are followed by the active line required for that system.
!  To activate one or the other, remove the "!MARK5A" or 
!  "" from the start of the lines where it appears, 
!  thus activating that line.  A script is available
!  to do that automatically (using sed).  
!
!  Typically, at the DSOC (AOC), there will be two subdirectories
!  for a piggyback observation, one for the MARK5A and one for the
!  MARK5C files.  The key  file will be kept in the base directory 
!  for the observation.  A script called runsch will be run to
!  create each type of file.  Here in the examples directory is a 
!  copy of the very-simple runsch file and an egrdbe.run file that
!  holds what would normally be typed.
!
!  The example is based on the RDBE fringe test of Dec 3 2010
!  with 5 stations:  LA, PT, HN, MK, BR
!

!  #! /bin/csh
!  # Shortcut for runsch for this directory.
!  ~cwalker/bin/runsch ../td009a.key MARK5C

!  where runsch is:

!  #! /bin/csh
!  /bin/rm temp.key
!  /bin/cp $1 .
!  echo Running $1:t with \!$2 replaced by blanks.
!  echo Modified key file is in temp.key
!  sed   's:\!'$2'::'  <$1:t >temp.key
