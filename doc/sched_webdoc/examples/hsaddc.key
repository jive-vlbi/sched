!  Sample schedule using the HSA (Effelsberg, GBT, VLA, and
!  VLBA - Arecibo not yet added).  It uses 2 Gbps recording
!  using the RDBE with the DDC personality at EB, GBT, and
!  VLBA.  It uses the WIDAR at the VLA.
!
!  Phasing the VLA is demonstrated.
!  Reference pointing at all stations is demonstrated.
!  Doppler tracking and bandwidth changing for a line source is
!  demonstrated.

!  Useful information for this type of scheduling:

!  For VLA phasing:
!    A phasing scan should be at least 4 times the pointing subscan
!    length (VLAPTIME - default 10 seconds)
!    The source should be at least 100 mJy at X band (J0217_7349 ~ 3 Jy)
!    Use vlamode to control the VLA phasing.  Intents can be used 
!      directly, but is not recommended.  The two cannot be used
!      together as there is too much risk of confusion.

!  Some things to consider for reference pointing:
!  VLA:
!    See the high frequency documentation for the VLA for details.
!    Don't try to carry pointing over > 20 deg.
!    Generally do it at X band.
!    Scan needs to be 2.5 minutes long on-source
!    Source > 0.3 (prefer 0.5) Jy and unresolved to the VLA
!    Don't carry solutions more than 30 deg on sky.
!    Don't use sources within 10 deg. of zenith.
!    Do once per hour, but 30 min during sunrise and sunset.
!  GBT: See the guide at 
!    http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~fghigo/gbtdoc/vlbinfo.html
!    Recommended for 8 GHz and up.
!    Interval 4-5 hr for 8-10 GHz, 3-4 hr for 12-16 GHz
!             1.5-2 hr for 18-26 GHz and 30-45min for 40-50 GHz.
!    At higher freq, also do when elevation changes > 15 deg
!    Use source >0.5 Jy within 15 deg of program source.
!    Allow 8 minutes or more on source in a non-recording scan.
!  Effelsberg:
!    Do for freq > 5 GHz.  (Maybe should have pointed for above scans).
!    8 Min if pointing on the VLBI source, 10 min if slew needed.
!    Probably can use same style as GBT.
!  VLBA:
!    Need > 10 Jy.  Mostly use masers.  Do at 7mm
!    Easiest to use AUTOPEAK to find and schedule sources.
!    Needs 1 minute for each pattern, up to 2, plus slew time.
!    With AUTOPEAK, SCHED adds pointing scans in sufficiently long
!    gaps between user scheduled scans.

! ==========================================================
! ==================== Setup Information ===================
! ==========================================================
!  These setups use the RDBE with the DDC personality on the VLBA
!  with 4 channels of 128 MHz each.  The DDC has flexible sidebands
!  so they just need to be set up right.  The VLA must have net
!  upper sideband.

!  Use the upper 2 128 MHz possible bands.  The polyphase filter 
!  on the input of the RDBE/DDC divides the 512 MHz IF into 3 
!  segments, 512-640 MHz, 640-896 MHz and 896-1024 MHz.  A baseband
!  should not span the crossover frequencies at  640 and 896 MHz
!  by a significant amount, and the LO end of the baseband (what goes
!  to DC) should be in the desired polyphase subband (or the wrong one
!  will get chosen).

!  We would like to put in a small offset from even MHz, say by 0.25
!  kHz to protect the pulse cal tones from alias issues.  Especially
!  with the 128 MHz bands, which will likely butt against the IF band
!  edges or the crossovers, care needs to be taken to make sure we don't
!  provoke use of the wrong polyphase filter output.  So the offset should
!  be away from a band edge or crossover in the direction of the rest
!  of the baseband.

!  Note some standard pointing setup files will be used in addition to
!  the ones here.

!      power levels.  They should be at least a minute each.  They 
!      don't have to be on source, but collectively they should take 
!      enough time to get to source from whereever the last project 
!      left the antennas.    Eight minutes should be reasonable.
!      Set the phasing mode off (vlamode=' ') to tell the system not to
!      break these scans into phasing subscans or attempt phasing.
!      Note that, if DWELL were used, there would be one minute gaps
!      thanks to TLEVSET in the station catalog.  Do a bit more than
!      one minute because of the use of dur.
