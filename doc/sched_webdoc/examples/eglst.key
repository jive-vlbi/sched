! Equipment constraints:
!    Stations.  Below each station code, the "o" indicates an
!       [optional] station that is to be used if it is available.
!       Change "o" to "r" if the station is required or change
!       "o" to "n" if the station is not to be used.

!           r   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   r
!       Minimum number of stations [9 (6 for 3mm)]: 8
!    Bands and polarizations.  Below each band code, insert "R" 
!       if the righthand polarization is to be used, "L" if the
!       lefthand polarization is to be used, "d" if dual 
!       polarizations are to be used, or "o" if the band is in
!       your setups but scheduling should not be constrained by
!       its availability.

!                        d                d
! Weather constraints: 
!    [appropriate for bands marked "L", "R", or "d" above
!     and for at least the minimum number of stations]
! Date constraints:
!    Preferred date(s), usually a series start: 
!    Excluded dates plus reason [none]:
!    Preferred interval between segments in days [none]:
!    Special conditions (e.g., a series with different
!       spacings in time): nighttime observations
! Start-time constraints:
!    Start-time range in (hhmm - hhmm), in PT_LST [none]: 16:00 - 17:00

!       The schedule
! ================================================================

!  Time intervals (dur, gap, dwell - but not prescan) are in 
!  sidereal units - shorter than UT units by ~1.0027.
!  Start and stop times are in LST for the specified station,
!  which is VLBA_PT for VLBI dynamic scheduling projects.
!  The start day can be specified as the "local sidereal day",
!  which is sort of like MJD, but for sidereal time.  These days
!  are listed on VLA schedules.  The regular UT date can also be
!  used (new feature).

lst      = VLBA_PT
year     = 2022
month    = 4
day      = 20 
start    = 16:30:00

! This is a phase referencing schedule with a lot of short scans.
! It also switches between 4 and 18 cm.
! For dynamic scheduling, the key calibration scans should be 
! toward the middle.  Some time could be lost off either end.

! Drive antennas to phase calibrator then start nodding
! The initial scan just allows a bit of cushion to be sure everything
! starts ok.  Normally VLBA projects are not exactly back to back so
! the schedules are loaded a bit early and the antennas can get to 
! source before the project actually starts.
