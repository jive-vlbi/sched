!  Example of a control file using the new RDBE and MARK5C
!  wideband digital backend and recorder.  This is a simple

!  VLBA schedule.
!
!  A SCHED standard setup file is used.

!          Demonstrate PREEMPT while at it for optional ends

!          Start with a few optional VLBA scans at the start:

dwell = 4:40  gap =  20

source = '3C279' /

! Into the core and protect against USNO preemption:
preempt = no

dwell = 4:40  gap =  20

group = 2  rep = 5
source = '3C279' /
source = '3C273' /


! Loop over M87 and M84, but ending on M87
