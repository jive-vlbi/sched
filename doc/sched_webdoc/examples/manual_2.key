!  BE002 example of 3C84 observations at 6 and 4 cm.
!
!    This example used to produce the same schedule as manual_1.key
!    but uses many SCHED defaults and is missing most comments.
!    It shows approximately the sort of file a users would 
!    normally make.  Note that all catalogs are defaulted.
!
!    On Nov. 1, 2012, this example was modified to use the GBT
!    rather than the VLA which can no longer do legacy style
!    observations.  Eventually it, like manual_2.key, will be
!    moved to the new wide band systems.

! ==========================================================
!  The first setup file shows the bare minimum that needs to
!  be specified.  Essentially all of this information would
!  be needed to choose one of the standard setup files.  This
!  one would correspond to v6cm-64-4-1.set, with a possible
!  slight frequency offset between what is in the specific
!  "standard setups" and what is generated using BAND=6cm.

!  For the second example setup, the user forces the 
!  frequencies, BBC's, sidebands, and format.  It still
!  relies on the frequency catalog for the IF assignments
!  and for many VLA parameters.  There are a lot more 
!  parameters that could be forced in extreme cases.
