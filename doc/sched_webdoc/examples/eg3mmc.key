!  Third example sched input file for VLBA observations at 3mm.
!  WARNING - this file uses parameters appropriate for the 
!  MARK5A recording system which is no longer in use on the VLBA.
!  However, it will generate files using the RDBE_DDC that will work.
!  The total bit rate is only 256 Mbps, which is low compared
!  to what the RDBE can do.
!  Please see eg3mmb.key or eg3mm_rd2.key for more modern examples
!  using the RDBE (DDC and PFB respectively) to get wider 
!  bandwidth.

!  This 3mm example shows the use of automatic insertion of
!  peaking scans using the peakinit section.  It also shows
!  what happens when PKWATCH is set.   Otherwise it
!  is the same as eg3mmb (although not updated to wide bandwidth).

!  Original 2000aug08 Craig Walker and Vivek Dhawan
!  Modified 10oct2000 RCW for better reference pointing.
!  Modified 21nov2000 RCW. Convert to autopeak.
!  Modified 4dec2000 RCW. Convert to imbedded peak commands.

!  this scan, the use of POINT to make a scan a pointing scan
!  is demonstrated.  With no argument, all stations, regardless
!  of pointing group, are included.  POINT will actually 
!  cause the pointing to be done at 7mm.  The second scan 
!  records data for fringe finding at 3mm.
