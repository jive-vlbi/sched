TAPE HANDLING at SCAN BOUNDARIES
</H3>

<P>
There are a number of concerns related to tape handling at scan
boundaries.  SCHED&nbsp; provides a variety of ways to specify what is
to be done.  Between scans, tapes can be kept running or can be
stopped.  If they are stopped, they can be started at the nominal
start time, or at some other time, usually earlier.  The actions
taken can strongly influence how well correlation proceeds.  Whenever
a tape is stopped, there is some time lost to resynchronize on
the correlator.  Also, with short segments of tape motions, it is
possible for the VLBA correlator to wind up sufficiently far out
of sync that it does not recover until either the end of the pass
or the end of the correlator job.  Basically, if the schedule consists
of long scans, it doesn't really matter much what is done.  But if
it has many short scans, such as when phase referencing, it can be
highly advantageous to keep the tape moving between scans.

<P>
Obviously, tapes must be stopped at the ends of passes so that their
direction of recording can change.  They also must stop when they are
changed.  If there are long gaps (many minutes) between scans, tape
use efficiency is enhanced if the tapes are stopped.  If automatic
tape handling is being used (normally true at the VLBA and VLA, but
not elsewhere), tape stoppage at pass and tape ends will happen
automatically and the user need not worry about them.  The user
should, however, provide occasional tape stoppages of at least 2
minutes (4 min in VLBA 512 Mbps mode) to allow for <A HREF="node24.html#SSSEC:READBACK">readback
tests.</A> These need not be at the ends of passes.

<P>
As the gap between scans gets shorter, or the scans become more
frequent, it becomes advantageous to keep the tapes rolling between
scans, assuming that the correlator does not require that they stop
(the older Mark III system had such a requirement).  One way to do
this is to use <A HREF="node83.html#MP:DUR"><TT>DURation</TT></A> rather than <A HREF="node84.html#MP:DWELL"><TT>DWELL</TT></A> to specify scan times and not give any command such as
<A HREF="node98.html#MP:GAP"><TT>GAP</TT></A> that will cause an interval to be scheduled
between scans.  This simply butts the scans together.  If there are gaps
between the scans, such as when <A HREF="node84.html#MP:DWELL"><TT>DWELL</TT></A> or
<A HREF="node98.html#MP:GAP"><TT>GAP</TT></A> are used, the default behavior of SCHED&nbsp; 
will automatically keep the tape running if the gap is less than
8 seconds times the speed up factor (usually 2).  That interval can
be adjusted with the parameter <A HREF="node118.html#MP:MINPAUSE"><TT>MINPAUSE</TT></A>.

<P>
One can request, preferably with parameter <A HREF="node161.html#MP:PRESTART"><TT>PRESTART</TT></A>, that recordings be started before the nominal start of
a scan.  This can cause the recording medium to keep moving if the gap
is short.  For longer gaps, it can help optimize the amount of
correlator output by providing time for the correlator to synchronize.
