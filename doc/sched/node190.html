<TT>VLAPEAK</TT>
</H3>

<P>
<TT>VLAPEAK</TT> sets the character to use in the VLA observing deck
(<I>...obs.y</I> file) to control the use of pointing corrections
determined during the observations.  The actual request to do a
pointing observation is made by setting <A HREF="node189.html#MP:VLAMODE"><TT>VLAMODE</TT></A> <TT>= IR</TT> in a separate pointing scan on a
calibrator.  The integration time must be set to 10 seconds, which is
the default that SCHED&nbsp; does not yet have the ability to modify.
<TT>VLAPEAK</TT> is used to specify whether or not a previous pointing
solution should be used as the starting point for the new measurement,
whether to save a previous solution for use as a future starting point,
and, for normal scans, whether to use the corrections from pointing
measurements to adjust the tracking position.

<P>
A pointing pattern takes 140 seconds if the VLA correlator integration
time equals the default 10 seconds, and some extra time should be
added. Use 150 seconds (after arrival at source) for one pointing
pattern and 4 minutes for two patterns. Two patterns are recommended.
Reference pointing is important at 7mm (Q band) and is useful, but not
required, at 1cm (K band).  The pointing should be updated
approximately every hour (some claim faster), and any time the
antennas move to a significantly different part of the sky. At
elevations above about 70 degrees, the azimuth changes rapidly in both
time and calibrator/source position offset.  Reference pointing may be
marginal at such elevations, and, if attempted, should be done more
often than at lower elevations.  For pointing at X band, a calibrator
(or target) source should be used that has a flux density in excess of
about 200 mJy on all VLA baselines.  See the VLA documentation for
more details and advice.

<P>
When observing at Q band (7 mm), it may be desirable to first
determine initial pointing corrections at a lower frequency, such as X
band (4 cm), and then, using those corrections as the starting point,
determine residual pointing corrections at Q band.  The final pointing
offset will then be the sum of the two.  Normally just the lower
frequency determination should be adequate -- the relative offsets
between bands are rather well known.  But the ultimate pointing
accuracy requires the final determination at the high frequency,
assuming, or course, that there is a source of adequate strength close
to the target.  Pointing should not be done only at 7mm.  The a priori
offsets can be bad enough that the pointing source will be on the edge
of the beam and a valid pointing solution may not be obtained.

<P>
<TT>VLAPEAK</TT> provides the necessary options to manage the pointing
corrections.  To understand the <TT>VLAPEAK</TT> options, consider that
there are ``primary pointing corrections'' and ``total pointing
corrections''.  The ``total pointing corrections'' are those that are
applied when running a normal scan that uses the reference pointing
results.  The ``primary pointing corrections'' are those used as the
starting point for a pointing determination.  This description is not
quite literally what the software does, but is correct in concept.
The <TT>VLAPEAK</TT> options are:

<P>
<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD><TT>" "</TT> (blank - the default).  Apply no previously determined
pointing corrections.  If this is a pointing scan (If <TT>VLAMODE=IR</TT>), clear any corrections that have been previously saved,
both primary and total.  Save any corrections that are determined in
this scan as the total pointing corrections, leaving the primary
corrections clear.  Blank should be used when not using
reference pointing.  It is also be used for a pointing scan
when no previously determined corrections are to be used as the
starting point.

<P>
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><TT>"T"</TT> Apply total pointing corrections.  Do not save any
corrections determined in this scan.  Use <TT>T</TT> during
normal observing scans when you wish to use the reference pointing
results.

<P>
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><TT>"S"</TT> This value should only be used for pointing scans
(<TT>VLAMODE=IR</TT>).  It causes the current total pointing corrections
to be saved as the primary pointing corrections.  The new primary
corrections are then used as the starting point for a new pointing
determination.  The result of that determination (primary plus
secondary) are then saved as the new total pointing corrections.  Use
<TT>S</TT> when doing double reference pointing any time you wish to
set the primary pointing corrections, usually just after a lower
frequency pointing determination.

<P>
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><TT>"R"</TT> This setting is just like <TT>VLAPEAK=S</TT>, except that
the values of the primary pointing corrections are not changed.  This
is used to update the total corrections, based on primary corrections
determined some time ago.  Use <TT>R</TT> to update the pointing at,
for example, 7 mm, retaining the previously determined solution from X
band.

<P>
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><TT>"D"</TT> This is the default.  If <A HREF="node54.html#MP:AUTOPEAK"><TT>AUTOPEAK</TT></A> has not been requested, this is equivalent to blank.
If AUTOPEAK was requested, SCHED&nbsp; usually manages <TT>VLAPEAK</TT>, but
the user can override the automatic settings.  Once that has been
done for a scan, SCHED&nbsp; would normally use the specified <TT>VLAPEAK</TT>
for all remaining scans.  <TT>VLAPEAK='D'</TT> indicates to the program,
that it should return to setting <TT>VLAPEAK</TT> itself.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Usually, when reference pointing is used, there will be a short
scan (see times above) with <TT>VLAMODE=IR</TT> and <TT>VLAPEAK=' '</TT>
to determined the pointing followed by the observing scans with
whatever <A HREF="node189.html#MP:VLAMODE"><TT>VLAMODE</TT></A> is needed and using
<TT>VLAPEAK=T</TT>.  The pointing scan will usually be at X band (4cm).
This is all that is needed in most circumstances.

<P>
When double reference pointing is desired, the pointing is first
determined at a lower frequency, then tweaked at the higher observing
frequency.  That is when <TT>VLAPEAK=S</TT> or <TT>R</TT> are used.  The
sequence would be a scan with <TT>VLAMODE=IR</TT> and <TT>VLAPEAK=' '</TT>
at the lower frequency, followed by a scan with <TT>VLAMODE=IR</TT> and
<TT>VLAPEAK=S</TT> at the higher frequency, followed by observing scans
with <TT>VLAPEAK=T</TT> and the desired <TT>VLAMODE</TT>, followed by
another tweak of the pointing using a scan with <TT>VLAMODE=IR</TT> and
<TT>VLAPEAK=R</TT>, followed by more observing scans.  The <TT>VLAPEAK=R</TT> - observing mode scans combination can be repeated several
times.  Eventually the pattern should be restarted with a new low
frequency scan.  Whether double reference pointing is actually better
than just doing the pointing at X band and leaving it at that is
somewhat controversial.

<P>
Tape may be stopped or left running during pointing observations.
You cannot combine pointing scans with phasing scans because they
require different <TT>VLAMODE</TT>s.
