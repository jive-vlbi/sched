Observing Strategy
</H2>

<P>
A tremendous amount could be said about observing strategy.  See the
article by Joan Wrobel in the book ``Very Long Baseline Interferometry
and the VLBA'' (1995: ASP) for a good discussion.  That book also
contains a lot of information about VLBI and is a good reference for
all observers to have.  Other important sources of information are the
``VLBA Observational Status Summary'' and ``General Instructions on
How to Prepare for Observing'' (which is sent to scheduled users).
These and other useful documents can be accessed on the Internet from
the <A NAME="tex2html56"
  HREF="http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/vlba/html/observing.html">``Observing with the VLBA''</A>
page.  This section of
the SCHED&nbsp; Manual will be limited to a few important concepts to keep
in mind while scheduling.  It is assumed that the observer already has
a reasonable idea of how much time is needed per source, what
frequencies to observe, etc.  The suggestions here are more oriented
toward smooth observing, processing, and calibration.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Fringe finders:</B> In order for the staff at a VLBI
correlator to tell if the correlation has gone well, it is necessary
to have occasional scans on sources that will provide strong fringes.
A minimum of one such scan per tape should be provided and it is a
good idea to have one every couple of hours.  The ``VLBA Observational
Status Summary'' and ``General Instructions on How to Prepare for
Observing'' documents mentioned above have lists of appropriate
sources.

<P>
The fringe finders can also be used for ``manual phase cal''.  This is
the process of aligning the phases and delays on all individual IFs.
This is simply done by running the fringe fitting program on the
calibrator and applying the results to all data.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Setting the flux scale:</B> Setting the flux scale of VLBI
images is not trivial.  Idealy, one would have a compact source of
known flux density that could be used, as 3C286 and 3C48 are on the
VLA, to calibrate the flux densities.  However, by their nature, sources
that are compact to VLBI (essentially none are unresolved) are variable
and, therefore, do not make good flux calibrators.  There are two ways
to deal with this.

<P>
One is to try to obtain the flux density of a compact calibrator at a
close enough time to the VLBI observations that variations will not be
significant.  At the time of the VLBI observations, some of the larger
antennas can be asked to measure flux densities of sources being
observed (see the <A HREF="#MP:TANT"><TT>TANT</TT></A> command.  Better yet,
if you have the phased array at the VLA or can get an hour or so of
VLA test time, accurate flux densities of your VLBI calibrators can be
measured.  In order to do this, be sure to include a VLA flux calibrator
(usually 3C286 or 3C48) in the VLA schedule.  You don't need to
record VLBI tape on it.

<P>
It is also possible to rely on the apriori calibration of the VLBI
antennas.  For this, it is best to look carefully at your data and
determine which subset of antennas is giving consistent calibration.
With the VLBA at intermediate frequencies, it is possible to get the
flux scale right to within a few percent at intermediate frequencies
this way.  You just have to be sure not to let any antennas with bad
weather or other problems contribute (don't just use gain
normalization in the self-calibration routines, for example).  If
you are going to rely on apriori calibration, be sure to obtain
some data at close to the frequencies at which antenna gains have
been measured.  These frequencies are given in the <I>vlba_gains.key</I>
available by anonymous ftp to ftp.aoc.nrao.edu.  This is the file
that you will need for VLBA calibration.

<P>
For any of these methods to work, it is best to include a strong,
compact calibrator and to observe it several times to check
consistency.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Setting the relative gains of antennas:</B>  Another invaluable
use of a strong, compact calibrator is to help ensure that all antennas
and all IFs have consistent calibration.  After apriori calibration
and setting of the flux scale has been done, a model of the calibrator
can be used to derive whatever additional gain adjustments are needed.
These can be applied to the whole observation to obtain the best possible
calibration, short of self-cal.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Readback tests:</B> If there is a gap of more than about 2
minutes in your schedule, the VLBA on-line system will do a readback
test to check the quality of the recording.  Without this, the
operations staff has no way to tell if the recordings are being made
ok.  It is a good idea to include such gaps every hour or two.
For 512 Mbps mode on the VLBA, using both tape drives simultaneously,
twice as much time (4 min) is needed for readback tests.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Phased VLA:</B> The phased VLA has special calibration needs.
If the target source is either too weak or too resolved to be used for
phasing up the array, special scans on a calibrator must be inserted
for this purpose.  This can be done with SCHED&nbsp; or VLA OBSERVE
(see <A HREF="node39.html#SSEC:VLAVLBI">the section on VLBI at the VLA</A> for details.  It can be done by the VLA data
analysts, but the schedule must contain gaps of adequate length.

<P>
Also, the effective beam of the phased VLA (or any other phased
interferomenter such as Westerbork) is the synthesized beam.  This
can be less than an arcsecond in the worst cases.  This places far
greater demands on source positions required for observing than
is typical at single antennas.  Be sure to provide positions
of sufficient accuracy, which can mean 0.1 arcsecond.

<P>
Anyone using the VLA for VLBI should consult the
<A NAME="tex2html57"
  HREF="http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/vla/vlbivla/current/html/">VLBI at the VLA guide</A>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Calibrator scans:</B> Except for phase or fringe reference
calibrators, there will typically be only 2 or a few more scans on
each calibrator of the types discussed above.  It is tempting to put
these scans at the beginning and end of the scheduled observing time.
However this is quite risky as those are the time periods most likely
to experience problems.  The beginning is especially risky because, if
there are any problems at a site, they may not have been fixed yet.
The end is ok, except at sites where the main target source has been
down for a while and the antenna has been idle.  It may not wake up
again cleanly for the calibration scans.  It is best to take time (a
few minutes on each calibrator) out of the middle of the schedule a
couple of times to get the calibration data.
