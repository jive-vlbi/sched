NUMBER of PASSES
</H3>

<P>
The amount of data that can fit on a tape depends on the length
of the tape, the tape speed, and on the number of passes.  The
Mark III and VLBA systems make longitudinal recordings using many
heads, all mounted on a head stack.  The width of each head is 38
microns and the ``head pitch'', or spacing between heads, is
698.5 microns.  This difference allows many passes to be recorded
with each head simply by shifting the whole head stack over by
something more than 38 microns between passes (48 microns is used
on the VLBA).  The Mark III systems typically use 12 passes while
the VLBA and Mark IV use 14.

<P>
Many recording modes do not use all of the heads at once.  Mark III
systems use 28 heads while VLBA and Mark IV systems use 32 (they all
actually use the same 36 head headstack so the head pitch etc is the
same).  Mark III Mode A uses all heads in a pass.  Modes B and C use
half the heads while Mode E uses a quarter.  There are many VLBA
modes, but they typically use a quarter, half, or all heads, although
lesser options are available.  If not all the heads are used in a
pass, more passes can be made at the same head position, increasing
the total time over which data can be recorded on tape.  The setup
file parameter <A HREF="node261.html#SP:TPMODE"><TT>TPMODE</TT></A> gives the number of
passes that can be recorded at each head position.  SCHED&nbsp; will
figure it out if it is not given and will report it in the summary.

<P>
If multiple setups are used in a project, SCHED&nbsp; will figure out
which uses the minimum number passes per head position (most
tracks per pass) and will use that number of passes per head position
for all setups.  This wastes tape because some tracks never get
recorded, but the alternative is a bookkeeping mess.  Therefore,
it is strongly recommended that all setups used in a project use
the same number of heads per pass (have the same <TT>TPMODE</TT>).

<P>
It is perfectly possible to use setups that record at different speeds
in the same schedule.  As long as they all use the same number of
heads, the tape will be used efficiently.  However, a change of
recording speed causes the VLBA correlator to need a new job.  This is
not a fundamental problem, but there is overhead for each job which
causes work for the correlator staff.  Current guidelines on how often
changes of this sort can be made can be found in the guidelines for
scheduling document found by going to the VLBA home page from the NRAO
home page on the WWW.  As of late 1996, changes more often than every
2 hours are discouraged.  Note that using different tape speeds in
different subarrays at the same time will preclude simultaneous
correlation and will present the current job script making program
with bookkeeping problems it is not equipped to handle.  Don't do it!

<P>
The total time that can be recorded on a tape is the time per pass
times the number of passes per head position times the number of head
positions.  The following table gives the total time per tape, and
also the total bit rate, for various combinations of these parameters.

   All tapes are assumed to be 17600 ft long.
   All recordings are assumed to be done at high density.
   Modes with 2 heads are MarkIV only.
   VLBA uses 2 drives at 256 Mbps each for 512 Mbps.

<P>
For mostly historical interest, below is the old version of the
table which includes the tape times for the low density and/or
thick tapes.  The 512 and 1024 Mbps modes were not available
at the time.

 *  Systems with Mark III hardware use 28 heads and 12 head positions
    so the recording times are lower.
</PRE>

<P>
If the tape allocated is insufficient to record for the whole allocated
time at the desired bit rate, there are several options.  The most
common is to use a duty factor of less than one -- to stop the tape
for some of the time.  Otherwise, it is necessary to cut down the
bit rate or to request more tapes (good luck).  Some periods of stopped
tapes are desirable for <A HREF="node24.html#SSSEC:READBACK">readback tests.</A>
