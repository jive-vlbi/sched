Release of 02 July 2002.
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Die if no location given for a station.  18 Oct 2001 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed use of un-initialized variable in Vex stuff that caused
problems occasionally on systems that do not automatically initialize
variables.  This was detected by a user doing plots.  18 Oct 2001 RCW
with fix found by Franco and agreed to by Huib.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Improve error message when <TT>OBSTYPE</TT> indicates recording
will be done, but all scans are flagged <TT>NORECORD</TT>.  13 Dec 2001 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Default IATUTC to value from SLA_DAT.  27 Dec 2001 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change TSETTLE to 6 for VLBA stations after experience with
a 43 GHz phase referencing run that had 15 second scans.  28 Dec 2001 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When there are between 2 and 24 sources and a UV plot is requested,
make a separate panel for each source.  2 Jan 2002 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add <TT>OBSTYPE = CONFIG</TT> to trigger a UV plotting and
optimizing mode useful for configuration studies.  A map of the
station locations is plotted and stations can be clicked on and off
(and highlighted) for plotting.  An optimizing mode is built in that
tries combinations of available stations and rates them based on the
number of cells filled in a uv grid.  Related parameters include <TT>MAPLIM</TT>, <TT>GRIDNR</TT>, <TT>GRIDNT</TT>, <TT>GRIDMIN</TT>, <TT>GRIDMAX</TT>, and
<TT>GRIDW0</TT>.  Also added the configuration studies section of this
manual.  Jan-Apr 2002 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Write <TT>extlo</TT> and <TT>extlosideband</TT> parameters to VLBA
control files for non-VLBA antennas whenever that IF channel was
not used in the previous scan in addition to whenever the value
actually changes.  This was needed by Effelsberg.  14 Jan 2002. RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Alter 3mm examples to no longer claim that the peaking setup
needs to be similar to the observing setup to avoid formatter
reconfigure.  This is not true if <TT>FORMAT=NONE</TT>.  14 Jan 2002. RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Checked the Lat/Long/Ht to XYZ conversion.  Altered the
ellipsoid by 1 meter to conform to current values found on the web.
The conversion now agrees with examples at geodetic sites at the cm
level assuming that everything is in WGS84, which is closely tied to
the ITRF.  29 Jan 2002 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Check that each frequency set is within the IF's specified in
the frequency catalog.  This gives a check after application of
Doppler or schedule specified frequencies.  4 Feb 2002  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Improve the ability to change the maximum number of stations
and some other parameters with only one change in sched.inc.  As a
result, the sched.inc file must be invoked before schset.inc.
2002may01  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Some restrictions on processing 512 Mbps observations at
JIVE have been lifted.  2002may  Huib

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There have been a number of updates to the catalogs for the EVN
stations, both in capabilities and positions.  Cormac Reynolds 2002may

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The ``settling time'' (<TT>TSETTLE</TT>) for the VLBA antennas was
increased from 2 seconds to reflect better what is actually seen in
phase referencing observations.  This will lengthen the gap between
scans when using dwell time scheduling.  2001apr RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change the default for <TT>RECORDER, DAR, and CONTROL</TT> to blank,
which gets interpreted as <TT>NONE</TT>.  Should have no effect in
practice because the catalogs have always specified these.  But
with the advent of <TT>DISK</TT> for Mark5, this will change.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add <TT>MINSETUP</TT> to the station catalog to deal with cases
where there is a minimum scan change time regardless of the slew
and settling times, but where this minimum time should not be
added to scan changes with long slews.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
