Scheduling Mark II Observations
</H1>

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; was originally written in about 1978 as the Caltech
Package scheduling program for Mark&nbsp;II VLBI.  Most Mark&nbsp;II
observations done since then were scheduled with it.  But the
program is outlasting the system that it was designed to
support.  I began the process of removing Mark II from SCHED&nbsp; 
when I learned that it is still in use in some parts of the
world.  Therefore, it is being retained for now.

<P>
Mark&nbsp;II recording systems have been removed from most
active VLBI stations and the main Mark&nbsp;II correlators are no longer
operating.  However, the system is not completely gone.  An old
Caltech correlator is being supported at Medicina and Mark&nbsp;II
recording systems are being supported at a few places.  For these
reasons, the Mark&nbsp;II specific features of SCHED&nbsp; have not
yet been removed.

<P>
Mark&nbsp;II observations typically use one of the Mark&nbsp;III or VLBA data
aquisition system baseband converters (called video converters in the
Mark&nbsp;III world).  Therefore much of the setup information required
for the wide band systems is also required for Mark&nbsp;II, although
only for a single channel.  A very few parameters are available that
are only for Mark&nbsp;II and the descriptions of those parameters should
be consulted.  In the main program input, the only such parameter
is <A HREF="node196.html#MP:TPREF"><TT>TPREF</TT></A> which helps get the tape changes
synchronized.  In the tape initialization parameters, parameter
<TT>TPTIME</TT> serves a similar purpose.  The main schedule parameter
<A HREF="node55.html#MP:AUTOTAPE"><TT>AUTOTAPE</TT></A> has special meaning for
Mark&nbsp;II observations.  Other than these special cases, the parameters
used for a Mark&nbsp;II project are essentially the same as for a wide
band experiment.  Of course, parameters related to control of the
wide band tape systems are not needed.

<P>
Tape management for Mark&nbsp;II observations is simpler than for wide
band observations.  Normally the tapes are run continuously for
4 hours per tape and then changed, usually by hand.  Correlator
operators normally prefer is all tapes are changed at the same
time, which can be arranged using <A HREF="node196.html#MP:TPREF"><TT>TPREF</TT></A>
or <TT>TPTIME</TT>.  The schedule should have scan breaks at the
tape change times (this will be forced by SCHED, so tape
changes might be requested at odd times if scan breaks don't occur
at the nominal 4 hour intervals.

<P>

<P>
Below is an example of a simple Mark II schedule.
Be warned that this aspect of SCHED&nbsp; is not being maintained
because Mark 2 is no longer available at most stations.  Also,
this example is not being tested with each release.

Below is an example setup file for Mark II observations.
This is the standard setup file <I>nug6cm.set</I> and contains
the correct information for the VLBA and VLA, which no longer have
Mark II recording equipment.  For a real Mark II observations, the
stations involved would have to be added.
