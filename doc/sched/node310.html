Release of 12 January 2001.
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Starting to set up satellite pointing.  Not finished for this
      release.  11 May 2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Quit if trying to do autoallocate for data going to
      non-VLBA correlators.  14June2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make message concerning mixed LST scheduling and UT day
      specification less intimidating for dynamic schedules.
      13July2000 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Small changes to prevent problems during checking of
      setups when reference pointing.  6Aug2000 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add example eg3mm.key  6Aug2000 RCW+Vivek

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Rationalize the pointing source file and call sources.pointing.
       6Aug2000 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Modifications for Mark IV 2 head wide-band mode.  22Aug2000 RCW and Huib.
      Added tapeini parameter HEADMODE.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Some clean up of output when a setup error is found.
      22Aug2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make paralactic angle right for each antenna mount.  Assumed
      ALTAZ in all cases before.  31Aug2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Get rid of unnecessary overlapping band messages when using
      default frequencies and 62.5 and 125 kHz bandwidths in a setup
      file.  1Sep2000 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Implement Locations file as an alternate to the station
      catalog for the source of some station information, especially
      station location and rate.  This simplifies maintenance.
      8sep2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Don't worry about changes in TPMODE (passes per head position)
      that only involve scans with FORMAT='NONE'.  10Oct2000 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Put the peakchan command, that requests reference pointing on
      the VLBA, in the main scan, not the setup scan.  10Oct2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add error condition for a request for tape autoallocation
      when the processing will be anywhere but Socorro.  11Oct2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Update the barrel roll defaults.  11Oct2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow FORMAT=NONE in non-recording scans.  This is useful for
      reference pointing on the VLBA.  11Oct2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add automatic insertion of reference pointing scans.  This
      works for the VLBA and VLA.  It is aimed
      as simplifying scheduling of high frequency observations.  It
      works on global or CMVA schedules, simply by limiting the stations
      for which the reference pointing scans are requested.
      Instructions for use of the function are in a new section in
      the manual.  Among other impacts, there is a new type of SCHED&nbsp; 
      input that gives controls for this function.  There are also
      some new examples that use it.  Dec 2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Some significant restructuring of SCHED&nbsp; for general code
      cleanup.  The areas involved in schedule optimization were
      especially impacted.  Oct-Dec 2000  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add note in summary file to explicitly say when no tapes are
      recorded.  Also issue a warning when the default OBSTYPE of
      NONE is specified along with recording type setup files.
      06Nov2000 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There was a change to the tape speed for VLBA format, low
      density tapes with non-VLBA control systems.  But it was
      decided not to keep the change.  But in the process, the
      sections of code involved were rewritten and simplified.
      Dec 2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add flags for horizons and down, not just slewing, in the output
      flag file.  This includes a determination of the rise or set
      time to withing 30 seconds.  22Nov2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add indicator in summary file for whether the scan is a pointing
      scan and whether or not tape is being recorded.  Note that
      anyone with software that parses the summary file scan listing
      will need to make changes for this.  28nov2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Programming items:  Add version numbers for the sections of
      code provided by different people.  Modify makefile to make
      sure the linked include files are really links.  05Dec2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add a digit to the format for frequency printouts to avoid
      problems when the frequency is over 100 GHz.  05Dec2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add a scan hours to the summary in addition to the tape hours.
      This will reflect time spent pointing etc.  05Dec2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Try to improve the first page of this manual to make it less
      intimidating.  Also improve various sections in the manual
      including the installation instructions.  Dec 2000, RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The files used for the distribution have been broken into
      three files, one for source code, one for catalogs, the manual
      etc, and one for the output of the Verify test.  Dec 2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Removed SKEDCONV from the distribution.  It is still
      available if needed, but it has not been used in years to
      our knowledge.  Dec 2000 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Preparing to change definition of VQ on VLA.  SCHED&nbsp; will use
      the new definition, but will always write LO and IF cards for the
      next few months so there is no confusion about what is months.  We
      will allow a few months for current schedules to flush through the
      system, then the on-line system will change.  Later SCHED will stop
      bothering with LO and IF cards when the standard is used.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Implemented writing VEX files with two head recording. Apart from
  changes in a number of places to allow track numbers above 33, this
  included the definition of a passorder with 6 positions, optimized
  for recording with two heads, after consulting Dan Smythe. Aug 2000
  Huib (VEX v68)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Relaxed constrains for use of the JIVE correlator. Aug 2000 Huib
  (VEX v68)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Dropped all TPNS() dependencies in VEX code Nov 2000 Huib (VEX
  v69)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Adjusted the definition of Barrel-rolling according to the latest
  wisdom; the definition is reversed in time with respect to the
  earlier definition. With the pending MkIV formatter fixes this
  becomes important. 512 Mb/s and barrel-rolling can be written for
  VLBA4 and MkIV drives when MODETEST is set. Nov 2000 Huib (VEX v69)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>All error messages in the VEX writing code were reviewed and
  updated when necessary. Nov 2000 Huib (VEX v69)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Checks on readback tests and the necessity to do post-passing was
  added for FS controled sites, other FS timing issues were cleaned
  up. Dec 2000 Huib (VEX v70)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Inserted a human readable date in VEX file. Checked that special
  characters are replaced in VEX names and quoted in VEX qualifiers
  (the SGRA* problem). Dec 2000 Huib (VEX v70)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Provided an example to write 512 Mb/s schedules eg512.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a problem in writing S2 schedules that used passes on more
  than one groups of S2 transports. Previously Sched would just request
  a complete new set of 8 tapes. As most VSOP projects use all 8
  transports simultaneously, this mode was not tested before. Dec 2000
  Huib.
