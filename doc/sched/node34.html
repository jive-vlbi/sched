S2
</H2>

<P>
The S2 system has been developed in Canada to support
the Orbiting VLBI missions VSOP and Radioastron, in addition to ground
based astronomy.  It is based on VCR technology and is relatively
inexpensive.  It is being used in Australia on the AT and at a number
of other sites around the world.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; supports observations on telescopes that have S2
recorders and are controlled through the Field System (FS9.3.7 or
higher). This is also done by creating a <TT>*.skd</TT> file in the VEX
format (see section on <A HREF="node32.html#SSEC:MKIV"><TT>MkIV</TT></A>).

<P>
The telescopes are characterized by <TT>RECORDER = S2</TT> and <TT>  CONTROL = VEX</TT>. Currently <TT>DAR = VLBA</TT> is completely supported
(it could be possible to also implement <TT>DAR = MKIV</TT>). For any
other <TT>DAR</TT> SCHED&nbsp; will attempt to schedule the observation with
a ``standard'' S2 mode, not using any knowledge on the content of the
``user signal''.

<P>
The modes supported for <TT>DAR = VLBA</TT> can be derived from a
document ``Compatibility of S2 and VSOPT recordings at S2 and VSOPT
Correlators'' by R. Wietfeldt, available at
ftp::s2.sgl.ists.ca:pub/s2/svlbi/s2vsop_compat_memo_v*.ps.Z.

<P>
Because the S2 recorders work in a way conceptually different from
VLBA (or MkIV) recorders, the user should bear the following in mind
when scheduling for S2 recorders.

<P>
Please note that no operational tests with SCHED&nbsp; and S2 recorders
have been completed yet, except for VSOP recording. Recently (Dec 2000)
it was discovered that observations that use more than 1 group of
transports (thus not VSOP modes) would not switch groups. This should
have been fixed.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The S2 recorder internally works with a number of recorders
  which each have one head and track. The S2 box uses 1, 2, 4 or 8
  recorders depending of the mode. In SCHED&nbsp; this is characterized by
  setting <TT>TPMODE</TT> to the number of groups will be used by the S2
  recorder.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The concept of fan-in or fan-out does not apply to S2 recorders
  in SCHED.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tape lengths for S2 tapes are specified as the length for
  standard <I>US VCR</I> recording in seconds. Thus, when the VCR
  cassette has 120 (minutes) on the label the tape lengths is 7200
  (ft) in SCHED.  European buyers should be careful; a ST-120 tape
  presumably is labeled SE-180, but should still be scheduled with
  TPLENGTH = 7200.  The S2 LP is obtained by using low density for
  which the <TT>TPSPEEDL = 6.3</TT> (ips) and SLP by using <TT>TPSPEEDH
   = 4.2</TT> (ips).  These speeds are chosen in order to simulate that a
  120 minute cassette will last for 7200*12/(6.3*60)=229
  minutes, consistent with the S2 documentation. For high
   density the same tape lasts for 343 minutes per group (multiply by
  <TT>TPMODE</TT> to get the total time).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>S2 tape motion is supposed to be ``adaptive''. The S2 recorders
  should start 2.5 minutes before a scan, stop only 0.1 minutes after
  the scan and generally continue to spin if any gaps are shorter than
  2.6 minutes. This is the default and only mode of control for S2
  recorders through SCHED.
