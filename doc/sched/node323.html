Mark&nbsp;III Observations
</H1>

<P>
To schedule Mark&nbsp;III projects using non-VLBA control file stations or
a Mark&nbsp;III correlator, it is best to use PC-SCHED, written by
Alan Rogers and Dave Schultz at Haystack (unrelated to SCHED), or
SKED, written by Nancy Vandenberg at Goddard Space Flight
Center.  PC-SCHED can read a very basic SCHED&nbsp; keyin file to
get scan times and generate Mark&nbsp;III schedules.  This is mainly useful
to help get the files needed by a Mark&nbsp;III correlator to process a
Mark III observation on the VLBA that was scheduled with SCHED.  PC-SCHED and SKED produce a ``Standard Schedule File Format''
file, which is also known as the ``sked file'', ``.skd file'', ``.drg
file'', or ``drudg file''.  This single file contains a complete
description of the experiment for all stations.

<P>
There is a program called DRUDG, associated with the Mark&nbsp;III
systems, that is used to convert the ``.drg file'' into snap files to
control the antennas and tape systems.  DRUDG can produce VLBA
control files and is used to do so regularily by the geodetic groups.
It is rarely used to make schedules for non-geodetic projects.  PC-SCHED also is able to produce VLBA control files, but this
capability has not been kept up-to-date and should not be used.

<P>
An NRAO program called SKEDCONV exists to convert ``.drg files''
files into SCHED&nbsp; keyin files. It is recommended that most VLBA
Mark&nbsp;III observers send their ``.drg files'' files to the AOC,
where the staff will use SKEDCONV and SCHED, along with
current setup files, to make the VLBA control files.  Instructions on
how to submit schedules are provided to observers when they are
allocated observing time.

<P>
There are no definite plans to support Mark&nbsp;III observations fully
with SCHED&nbsp; because the system will soon be obsolete.  It will be
replaced by the <A HREF="node32.html#SSEC:MKIV">Mark&nbsp;IV system</A>, which is basically
an upgrade that uses the same tape recorders (upgraded) and heads, but
a new formatter and wider bandwidths from the video converters.
SCHED&nbsp; supports the Mark&nbsp;IV system through the VEX control files.
However, as mentioned elsewhere, the Japanese systems related to VSOP
have been designed around the ``.drg file''.  Hooks have been provided
in SCHED&nbsp; where they can attach routines to write ``.drg file''
output.  If this project is completed, SCHED&nbsp; may acquire at limited
Mark&nbsp;III capability.

<P>
Mark&nbsp;III observations on stations that use VLBA control files (VLBA,
VLA, and Green Bank) can be scheduled directly with SCHED.  The only
difference between Mark&nbsp;III and VLBA format projects on these antennas
is the data format on the tape (see the setup file input <A HREF="node246.html#SP:FORMAT"><TT>FORMAT</TT></A>) and various details in the setup files.  Mark&nbsp;III
observations have a one-to-one correspondence between tracks and
channels, use one bit samples, and do not barrel roll.  They typically
use 7 or 14 channels, although Mark&nbsp;III format can be used on any
project with no fan out.  Anyone scheduling Mark&nbsp;III observations
should either use <A HREF="node227.html#SSEC:SETSTD">standard setup files</A> or, if
making their own, should start with a standard file as a template.
Such observations can be correlated on the VLBA correlator, but
require production of a ``.drg file'' if sent to a Mark&nbsp;III correlator.

<P>
The PCFS can control Mark&nbsp;III observations on Mark&nbsp;III, Mark&nbsp;IV, and
VLBA hardware.  However, it will only do this with a Mark&nbsp;III type
``.drg file'' for input.  Since SCHED&nbsp; does not produce such files,
it cannot currently schedule Mark&nbsp;III format observations on systems
that do not use the VLBA control files (e.g. the EVN).  The ``.drg
file'' is also required to control Mark&nbsp;III correlators, and therefore
SCHED&nbsp; cannot be used to control experiments that are destinated for
such correlators without causing considerable extra effort to generate
such a file later.  A possible future upgrade to the PCFS and SCHED&nbsp; 
would allow the use of VEX files to control observations on Mark&nbsp;III
hardware or configure Mark&nbsp;III modes on Mark&nbsp;IV hardware.

<P>
The VLBA correlator is capable of correlating VLBA, Mark&nbsp;IV, and
Mark&nbsp;III formats against each other as long as the sample rates and
recording speeds were the same.  Therefore the VLBA and Mark&nbsp;IV
stations of a global observation that also involves Mark&nbsp;III stations
could be scheduled with SCHED&nbsp; if it were to be processed in Socorro.
Of course, the Mark&nbsp;III stations would still have to be scheduled
somehow, so one of the other programs would probably be used anyway.
