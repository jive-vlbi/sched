Release of 18 September 2003.
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Add output of velocities for sources in the summary file.
2002aug29 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change from assuming that altaz antennas start at the midpoing
of their azimuth range to start at the low end.  This should deal
with some problems seen by Effelsberg.  RCW  24 Jan 2003.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Adding Mark5 for VLBA  RCW Jan 2003.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Removed Mark2 RCW 6 Feb 2003.  The end of an era - I thought.
Put it back 14 Feb 2003.  I have been informed by Igor Molotov that
Mark II is still used occasionally in Russia (4 sites), Ukraine,
Latvia, Poland, India, and China and still exists at Noto and
Medicina!  It is used for radar observations that don't need much
bandwidth.  When I tested the reinstallation, I found and fixed a
problem with old and new versions that caused a core dump.
Just before the 18 Sept release I found another problem with the
tape change request handling.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added the runlog.  This will take most of the output that used
to go to the terminal and put it to a file, where it should be easier
to examine, and to send to someone else when needed.  It will take
a while to convert all the write statements in the code.  Also a
messages.txt file has been added to the catalog with text messages
that can be sent to the runlog by routine WRTMSG.  This makes more
extended explanations of problems much easier to code.  6 Feb. 2003

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added 1024 Mbps capability for MarkIV, 2 head observations.
Basically this means adding the option for 16 Mbps per track.
20 Feb 2003.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add a plot map option to the configuration search mode.  Activate
by typing ``<TT>p</TT>'' (bw) or ``<TT>P</TT>'' (color) while the map
of station locations is on the screen.  26 Feb 2003  RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Restructure the sections that set the fan out modes.  This was
a code maintenance issue.  Users should not see a change.  13 Mar 2003 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Proper motion and paralax added.  This is much different from the
planetary motion that was already in place.  Note the source catalog
should now use EQUINOX rather than EPOCH.  20 Mar 2002 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Socorro correlator maximum output data rate increased to
1000 kbytes/sec as per announcement from Jon Romney.  9 May 2003 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added acceleration to the slew calcualations. Sometime early 2003,
RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add warning about possible phase jumps when setting flukes to
frequencies that are not multiples of 10 MHz.  15 May 2003. RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add more information about frequencies etc to the OMS file.  This
was requested by Lorant to aid in automatically assigning calibration
information to channels.  19 May 2003.  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Warn for VLA schedules over 1 day.  This can cause problems with
restarts since the obs file has no day number on each scan.  22 May 2003
RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Warn for Socorro correlator requests for more than 1024 spectral
channels.   22 May 2003  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make tests for which correlator is used consistent.  Sched will
ignore any characters following the recognized correlator specification
which must start in column 1.  4 June 2003 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add source separations for sources closer than 15 degrees to the
summary.  17 July 2003 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>New Vex code with Mark 5 support.  9 Sept 2003 CR.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
