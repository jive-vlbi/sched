Release of 30 March 1998.
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Prohibit use of 2 digit year.  Warn, but don't abort with
      year outside 1900 to 2100.  Convert to 4 digit years in
      VLBA control files.  20Nov97.  These are in response
      to Richard Simon's y2k crusade.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix bug found by Norbert Bartel where a postpass warning goes
      out even on VLBA sites using 1 drive.  5dec97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix bug that appeared when some setups needed the frequency
      catalog and others didn't.  10dec1997  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add some more variables to SAVE parameters that were missed
      before.  Thanks to Franco Tinarelli for finding them.  15Jan98.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>From Franco on plot stuff (9Jan98):

<P>
Another problem exists with the PGPLOT libraries and the colours usage.
  In Linux I've recompiled sched with f77 and in the plot window the
  background color of graphics window is black and not gray and the yellow
  border do not appears ( like in the Alpha WS). This is very strange
  because in Linux the problem do not exist with the sched executables compiled
  with g77 and the same pgplot libraries, and in the Alpha WS disappears with
  the pgplot libraries compiled with the shared options.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add routine OPTUPT (<TT>OPTMODE='UPTIME')</TT> to create a long
      sequence (OPDUR) of scans from each
      input scan.  This is meant to be part of allowing SCHED features
      to replace UPTIME.  This is used if OPTMODE=UPTIME is invoked.
      20 Jan 1998  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Franco's plotting stuff is getting pretty good.  I will probably
      use it as the standard plotting section from now on.
      First really useful version installed 21 Jan 98.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added baseline length table to summary file.  10 Feb 98.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed vsx-128-4-2.set to really be dual polarization rather
      than RCP only.  17 Feb 98 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added routine SIDTIM.  Called in CRDVLA - no real change there.
      Mainly this was to help the UPTIME style plotting stuff of
      Franco's.  20 Feb 98  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Changing default format to be correct for S2.  S2's often have
      DAR type of VLBA or MarkIV which triggered the wrong default.
      20 Feb 98  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Restructuring some of tape handling code to separate automatic
      tape handling from other types and to completely separate S2.
      Feb 98.  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tried to set up multiple line formats as concatenated character
      variables to keep some compilers happy.  Feb 98 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Automatic tape allocation only applies to sites with VLBA
      control systems and more than one tape drive.  AUTOALOC and
      AUTOREV made site dependent.  24 Feb 1998. RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix bug where if POL=L, you actually got RCP.  POL=LCP was ok.
      25 Feb 98  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Do not allow ``!'' in cover information.  They mess up the
      VLBA on-line parsing of the files.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Arrange to use position information from the VLBA correlator
      data base in the standard stations.dat catalog.  A new program
      that is very much like <I>MAKESETUP</I>, called <I>MAKESTA</I>
      is used to merge the information from the correlator data
      base into with the rest of the information about station
      equipment.  25Nov98  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change tape move time at end of S2 scans from 0.5 min to 0.1 min.
      27Feb98 RCW.  2Mar98 Huib in the Vex stuff.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix ephemeris routine stub to match new name and call sequence
      of the real one, which changed a few months ago.  2Mar98 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Multiple occurrences of $PROCEDURES VEX section is fixed.
      2Mar97 Huib.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Warning on FS setup times checks that station was actually in
      previous scan.   2Mar97 Huib.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add NOSETUP item to aid in planning with hypothetical stations
      and stations for which setup information is not present.
      5Mar98. RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix bug that appeared when in-line setup files were placed
      at the end of the schedule.  17Mar98  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Remove the long loops in the ROTPAT section.  The on-line
      system can't do them.  Add warnings about durations of pointing
      and rotpat scans.  25mar98 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
