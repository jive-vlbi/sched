Release of 4 Dec. 1996
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Discourage picking successive scans on same source when using the
      subarrayed sky coverage optimizer (OPTCSUB).  11Sep96 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>No longer attempt to space to the end of tape between scans
      when there is going to be a turn-around.  With speed-up on
      the correlator, this can put the correlator badly out of sync.
      12Sep96  RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add TAPESYNC to try to force synchronized tape changes.  This
      is especially useful in optimized schedules with subarraying.
      Sep 96 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Made cosmetic changes to sched.inc and some clean up of source
      namehandling, including a bug fix in the planets code.
      1 Oct 96 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added new routine STMSG for startup messages.  1 Oct 96 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added a new routine SHORTN for getting the short source name.
      1 Oct 96 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add ability to use station codes in place of station names
      for the input parameters STATIONS, REWIND, FASTFOR, TAPE, and
      REVERSE.  This had the side effect of requiring that the
      station catalog be read by the time the first scan is
      processed.   4 Oct 1996 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix calls for planet positions. 4 Oct 1996

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Print 0 for dwell time if source is down.  4 Oct 96 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Increase the maximum number of channels to 32.  This required
      quite a bit of work as 16 was built in in several places.
      9 Oct 96  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Made various changes to help the Mark IV and VEX support.
      Set the default low density Mark IV tape speeds to the
      same as Mark&nbsp;III.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Set the maximum correlator data rate to 350 kbps.  14Oct96 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Don't allow BW to be specified in the main schedule if VEX
      output is to be written.  This significantly simplifies the
      generation of setups in the VEX file.  15 Oct 96 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add DOPINCR to allow doppler frequency setting for systems
      with different frequency setting capabilities from VLBA and
      Mark&nbsp;III/IV.  For example, VSOP only hits the nearest MHz.
      15 Oct 96 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Require that the user provide many of the cover and correlation
      parameters to give the observatories and correlators the
      information they need.   Internally, put all
      parameters in variables to reduce dependence on the print format.
      Eliminate the parameter TELEX since as far as I know, this
      system is no longer used.  16 Oct 96  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add a mechanism, and a program, for easy including of examples
      in this manual.  This should make keeping the examples up to
      date and tested easier.  17 Oct 96.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add SLEW to the allowed summary items (SUMITEM).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow MKIV dar and S2 recorder at the same site.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add the ability to use environment variables in UNIX file names.
      This simplifies specification of catalogs names.  Also adjust
      the default catalog names to work on a UNIX system with the
      standard SCHED directory substructure and with $SCHED defined
      to point to the SCHED base area.   21 Oct 96  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add FREQREF to schset.inc to make it easier for other routines
      to get the observing frequency.  Set FREQREF in RDSET and/or
      SETFREQ.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add POL to schset.inc to make it easier to keep track of
      polarization.  Add POL to setup input variables.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Changed SPEEDUP in sched.inc to RSPEED and added SPEEDUP to
      schset.inc.  This improved bookkeeping.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Prohibit frequency switching when writing VEX.  24 Oct 96.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add MJD to summary output.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Restructure writing of summary file and add number of passes,
      tapes, and readback tests.  24 Oct 1996.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Extend the leveling scan for pointing observations to twice
      PTDUR to make it long enough to get pcx tests.  24 Oct 1996.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Force the doppler calculations to give the same LO frequency for
      channels sharing a BBC.  This is mainly for Upper/Lower
      sideband pairs.  Added subroutine SBSIDE. 25 Oct 1996 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add consistency checks across channels and setup groups in
      a setup file in the area of frequency and sideband assignments.
      25 Oct 1996.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Protect against scans shorter than one second.  25 Oct 1996.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Remove tape stuff from VLAONLY and NOTAPE observations. 28 Oct 96.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Set up for defaulting many SETUP parameters based on input from
      a frequency catalog.  This was a major change involving
      considerable additional code and a new input file which is
      called <I>freq.dat</I> in the catalogs subdirectory.  If users
      are observing a frequency covered by the frequency catalog, they
      only need to specify generic information like observing
      frequency, polarization, number of bits per sample etc.  SCHED&nbsp; 
      can then fill in all the site dependent parameters like
      firstlo, synthesizer settings, channel names etc.  This
      should greatly simplify the process of making setup files.
      See <A HREF="node224.html#SEC:FRQCAT">the frequency catalog section</A> for a lot more information.  SCHED&nbsp; also uses
      the frequency catalog information to check any setups provided.
      If it does not recognize the setup, it will complain.  For
      VLBA observations, this probably means there is a problem.
      For other sites with less complete information in the frequency
      catalog, it is just a flag to be careful with what you are
      doing.

<P>
In the process of making these changes, it became possible to
      specify multiple stations for a setup group (SETSTA now has two
      indices).  With only the generic parameters specified, this
      can be useful.  Internally, SCHED&nbsp; expands such a case to
      have a separate group for each input station before adding
      all the LO values etc.  After that, only the first station
      of the list is used.      29 Oct 96.  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Set up defaulting of parameters like NETSIDE and BBC in
      SETCHAN.  This can be a bit risky since different defaults
      require different frequency settings, which aren't defaulted.
      2 Nov 96. RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Did some cosmetic reformatting of the summary file.  4 Nov 96 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Clarify VLA vs VLB IF's in sum file.  Warn of special patching.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow POL=DUAL in setup.  Will cause R/L pairs to be specified.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Adding FREQFILE and FREQLIST for frequency defaulting and
      display.  FREQLIST can be used to get a list of possible
      frequency setups from the frequency catalog for a desired
      sky frequency.  SCHED&nbsp; will generate the list, writing it
      to the screen and to a file called <I>frequencies.list</I>.
      6 Nov 96 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Put catalog of origen into summary file source list.  Also move
      SRCFILE and STAFILE to sched.inc.  8Nov96 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow the setup file to specify generic FORMAT=VLBA or
      FORMAT=MKIV.  SCHED&nbsp; will figure out the appropriate fanout,
      usually trying to obtain a speed up factor on the VLBA
      correlator of two, if possible.  12Nov1996 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Default TPMODE to the actual one so that the user does not
      need to specify it in the setup file.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Put FE, SYNTH, and pcal stuff in the setup summary in the
      summary file for VLBA stations.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow plotting without cover information.  This helps keep
      schedules used for planning purposes simple.  18 Nov 1996.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix bug that caused OPTMODE='SCANS' to start at input start
      time of first good source (perhaps involving big delay from
      the experiment start time). 18 Nov 1996 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Increase number of scans and number of setup files allowed.
      The program size is now about 15 Mbytes.  The size is
      sensitive to these two parameters which can be altered
      easily in the include files.  18 Nov 96.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow VSOP control, dar, and recorder types.  Add a stub for
      writing VSOP drudg files.  18 Nov. 96.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Activate axis type XYEW (Hobart).  Rewrite XYNS routines while
      at it. 19 Nov 1996.  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Modify all of the standard setup files for new defaulting
      capabilities.  20 Nov 1996

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add FOCUS, ROTATION, AZCOLIM, and ELCOLIM as scan inputs.
      These are for VLBA testing only.  20 Nov 1996  RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add ROTPAT, FOCOFF, and ROTOFF for focus/rotation test patterns.
      Again these are for VLBA testing (the 3mm receiver has arrived
      at Pie Town!).   25 Nov 1996  RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add speedup factor to summary.  27 Nov 1996

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add warnings if baseband channels overlap in frequency. 27 Nov 1996.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Use the setup frequency for a source for which no velocity was
      specified even if DOPPLER was specified.  27 Nov 1996.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix data set size calculation -- data rate was ok, but it did not
      allow for the fact that processing happens faster with a
      speed up greater than 1. 3 Dec 1996.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tested and works under Linux.  4 Dec 1996.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added VLBI at the VLA example provided by Joan Wrobel.  4 Dec 1996.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow norecord scans to count for readback tests and don't
      include them in the tape time calculation.  4 Dec 1996

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
