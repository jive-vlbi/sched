Release of 12 February 2001.
</H2>

<P>
It seems that we are having teething problems with the new reference
pointing capabilities.  This release makes available some important
fixes required for 3mm VLBA projects.  But it does not have some fixes
for VEX problems that will affect CMVA runs.  So there will be another
release in a couple of weeks.  The changes here are not significant
for users not attempting reference pointing with <TT>AUTOPEAK</TT> or
other mechanism that invokes setup files with <TT>FORMAT=NONE</TT>.  If
you don't need this one right now, it is recommended you wait for
the VEX fixes.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>SCHED&nbsp; did not behave gracefully when there was a station listed
       in the peaking command file that is not in the stations catalog.
       Make it die properly with an error message that might allow
       users to understand what was wrong.  07 Feb 2001  RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Found another bug relating to looping over scans.  This time
       a loop went from the first output scan to the last input scan,
       which is over no scans if output is not the same as input.
       As with the earlier bugs, this only affects <TT>AUTOPEAK</TT> users
       or users of obscure optimizing modes.  And this time, it only
       affects VEX users.  07 Feb 2001 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix problem with initialization of track assignment output when
       the first scan had FORMAT=NONE, such as a pointing scan.  With
       this, only the first station got track assignments.  08 Feb 2001 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Improve the way readback tests are counted.  The main effects will
       be on what happens at the start of a schedule.  Also, if <TT>DEBUG</TT>
       is set, SCHED will write a line each time it finds a readback
       test slot.  08 Feb 2001  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add an <TT>OVERRIDE</TT> input parameter and internal logical that
       can be used by programmers to allow them to exercise code in
       ways now allowed for users.  For example, if users cannot be
       allowed to use some feature because of known bugs, but programmers
       need to test it to fix the bug, <TT>OVERRIDE</TT> can be used to
       provide a ``back door'' in.  09 Feb 2001.  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Don't allow VEX and FORMAT=NONE.  There are bugs.  This should
       be fixed soon, but we need to get a release out to fix some of
       the above issues for 3mm VLBA observations.  09 Feb 2001  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Remove the ``*'' from a the names of many pointing sources in
       <I>sources.pointing</I> and <I>peak.cmd</I>.  These were causing
       problems for other software downstream.  This might cause some
       editing to be needed in existing files in the dynamic scheduling
       queue.  9 Feb 2001.  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In VEX code, change ``*'' to ``X'' rather than ``?'' in def names.
       We would like to be able to use ``*'' in source names, but users
       should be wary that they might encounter problems in post-processing.
       12 Feb 2001. Huib.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Modify the source list in <I>peak.cmd</I> so that the ones
       that are used for reference pointing if the user does not check
       source quality are only those what we trust the most.  Names of
       other possible sources are left in the file in comments.
       12 Feb 2001. RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make the data rate limit warning sensitive to wide band observations
       where 2 pass processing is required anyway.  In the process separate
       dealing with Socorro correlator parameters from others.  15 Mar 2001 RCW.
</LI>
