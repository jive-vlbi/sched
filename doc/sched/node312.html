Release of 1 July 1999.
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>CRDVLA temporarily stored FLUKEA and FLUKEB in single precision
       which led to round off problems in some special cases.  Fixed
       04Jan98  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix translation of VLA bandwidth code into an actual bandwidth.
       Was BW=50/(n+1).  Should be BW=50/2**n.  15jan99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Franco fixed a bug that caused improper reinitialization of
       LST plot limits when a RESTART is done.  26jan99.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Got rid of special Plot_Tinarelli directory.  Franco's stuff
       is now in the Plot directory.  The old, pre GUI, plot stuff
       was tarred and put in the $SCHED/OLD directory.  26jan99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in SETFCAT, the routine that chooses the frequency
       catalog entry to use.  In choosing between two entries with
       good frequencies, it would choose the lower priority (higher
       numerical value of PRIORITY) one if the observing frequency
       was better centered.  28jan99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Changed gap required for a readback to 1:45.  For the on-line
       system, it is really 1 minute plus 1 second per track and
       it can't be too close to the start of a pass (SCHEDdoes not
       test that).  This change was triggered because the old 2:00
       test, combined with LST scheduling, was causing lots of
       readback warnings that were not needed.  8feb99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Blocked the warning about scans crossing 0 hr UT.  This is
       no longer a concern, as far as I can tell.  The Socorro
       correlator will put a job boundary there, but this should be
       benign.  16feb99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow the use of UT dates (YEAR, MONTH, DAY) for an LST
       schedule.  This might make dynamic scheduling easier.
       Cleaning up code relating to setting scan times (before
       optimization).  17feb99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Count the number of times the tape stops.  If it is more
       than 10 times per hour, warn the user about excessive stops
       and point out new parameter MINPAUSE.  17feb99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add parameters MINPAUSE and PRESTART.  PRESTART causes the
       start of tape motion to be moved forward to allow for
       synchronization at playback time.  MINPAUSE causes the
       use of continuous tape motion if the tape stop time would
       between 2 scans would be less than MINPAUSE times the speed
       up factor.  Related to this, there are significant updates
       to the manual, especially the sections on scan times.
       24feb99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add warning for VLBA correlator projects going to the VLBA
       correlator if <TT>AUTOTAPE=2</TT> is not being used.  22feb99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add warning when DOPPLER set freuqencies overlap more than
       20
</LI>
<LI>Update OK modes.  Now almost all are allowed.  26Feb99 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Remove <I>UPTIME</I> from the SCHED&nbsp; distribution.  01Mar99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add concept of frequency sets.  This is to aid bookkeeping
       when the deviations from the setup file frequencies are altered
       with FREQ, BW, or DOPPLER.  Now in the summary file, all
       frequency sets are listed along with the setup file summary.
       2mar99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Altered VLBI at VLA example in manual to show full specification
       of VLA parameters.  3Mar99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Adding BAND for setups.  This should allow elimination of
       most standard setup files.  4Mar99 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added pcal sets to organize the pulse cal detector specifications.
       This is mainly to simplify bookkeeping, especially for Vex.
       13Mar99  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added a .flag file output that can be used to flag predicted slew
       times with UVFLG.  13Mar99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Remove stations from a scan when they are both using autotape=2
       and the source is not up.  This is to help reduce tape
       consumption, especially for MK.  It is only done for automatic
       tape allocation because of the risk of messing up tape
       management in other cases.   18mar99.  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add VLBA4 to the DAR options.  Started 24mar99.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add VLAPEAK parameter.  Could not keep united peakup options
       and allow the various VLA reference pointing options.
       30mar99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Don't make a crd.y file when scheduling pure VLA observations.
       31mar99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When dwell time scheduling was in use, SCHED&nbsp; would not make
       scans that cross midnight UT.  Don't bother any more -- allow
       scans to cross midnight.  31mar99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Stop tape at end of autoallocation projects.  12May1999 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Updates of the <TT>DUR</TT> and <TT>DWELL</TT> sections of the manual.
       17may99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add a cross check for reasonableness of the tape length and
       density specification for VLBA tapes.  Huib may add same for
       Mark IV.  17may99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Prevent missing samplerate in VLBA schedules when first scan
       is pointing.  7jun99 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>While SCHED&nbsp; is running, write out the full time range to help
       when fine tuning to fill a time allocation.  This from Ketan.
       13Jan99.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VEX section upgraded to 1.5.60 21Jun99, Huib
<BR>
S2 tape changes corrected
<BR>
Checks use narrow filters in MkIV DAR
<BR>
Upgraded to much more robust freq change scheme
<BR>
BW changes now allowed in VEX
<BR>
Freq/Dop changes in modes with different BBC assignment allowed
<BR>
Reduced memory use VEX section
<BR>
Check tape starts synchronous for VEX
<BR>
Axis offsets, negative Vlsr now reported
<BR>
Check against high density recording on thick tapes
<BR>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Prevent different tape start times for a scan when a VEX output
       is requested.  RCW 20jun99

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Improve the count of scans (remove bug).  RCW 20jun99

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Put experiment code in upper case on VLA observe deck.  RCW 20jun99.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Don't die if S2 or other format requested for processing in
       Socorro - allows translators.  29June1999 RCW.
