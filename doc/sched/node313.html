Historical Notes
</H1>

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; was written by R.C.&nbsp;Walker (RCW) in the late 1970's for Mark&nbsp;II VLBI
scheduling. It was part of the Caltech VLBI package.  It received a
number of modifications over the following decade by the author and
others, including Tim Pearson, John Benson, and Mark Hodges. Beginning
in 1988, the program was extensively revised by RCW to accommodate
VLBA, and eventually global VLBI, scheduling.  In 1991, a project to
write VLBA OBSERVE was been begun by the NRAO with the
programming being done by Wes Young.  SCHED&nbsp; development was at a a
minimal level during this development project as it was thought that
the program would soon be retired.

<P>
In the Fall of 1995, the VLBA OBSERVE project was cancelled.  An
intensive effort was made then to add many of the features whose need
had become apparent during the period of minimal development.  In the
Spring of 1996, Huib van&nbsp;Langevelde of JIVE, then stationed at NRAO,
began work on the VEX additions which became a significant part
of the program.  Also, at about that time, Brian Butler provided the
code needed to add the planet capability that is important for single
dish pointing and gain measurements at high frequencies.  Rick Lively
provided systems support including writing makefiles and helping with
interactions with users who were trying to install the programs on
other machines.  In January 1998, Franco Tinarelli of Bologna delivered
the first code for point-and-click control of the SCHED&nbsp; plotting
functions and has been supporting the plot functions ever since.  In
2002, Cormac Reynolds took over support of the Vex portions of the
code from Huib.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; is currently the primary scheduling program used for
astronomical VLBI.  It is also capable of scheduling many types
of observations on the VLA.
