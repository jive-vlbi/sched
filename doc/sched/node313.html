<BR>
Release of 1 Aug. 1997
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Add some items to SAVE in tpsch to keep from having problems
      with tape change time warnings.  11Feb97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Set proper S2 default tape speeds. 12Feb97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Put comment to screen when postpassing single tape site. 12Feb97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in telescope position code for XY antennas. 12Feb97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Check that the BBC frequencies for VLBA stations are
      multiples of 10 kHz.  13Feb1997.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Remove complaint about more than 2 drives (triggered by S2) and
      chech tape initialization NDRIVES against max given in catalog.
      24mar97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>VEX enhancements by Huib 25mar97 
<BR>
DAR = NONE works OK, producing VEX files readable by fs9.3.8 
<BR>
VEX mode name will always be unique. 
<BR>
XYEW and XYNS mounts allowed for VEX output. 
<BR>
Cleared up some warnings that were inappropriate for S2. 
<BR>
Put in a number of warnings when schedule would viloate PCFS capbilities.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Split the station and frequency catalogs into portions to
      maintained by huib and I.  There is a script "Update" which
      combines them to form the single catalogs seen by the users.
      RCW 25mar97

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add OKMODES routine and MODETEST input to discourage, but allow
      in special cases, the use of untested Mark&nbsp;IV and VLBA
      recording modes.
      RCW 20may97

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Protect against too many tracks.  This may need to change
      when we go to 512 mode.  In SETCHAN.  RCW 21may97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add SETBBC.  This should allow VLBA and Mark IV setups to leave
      the BBC assignments for SCHED to determine.  The defaulting of
      sidebands in SETCHAN was also beefed up to those could be left
      for SCHED to do.   RCW  6jun97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add routine SETSTDEF to establish default stations for a setup
      file if none are given.  Also it will eliminate stations that
      do not use the setup in the schedule to keep the number of
      setup groups down.  12Jun97  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add blank default for FORMAT.  If FORMAT = ' ' or FORMAT is not
      given, FORMAT will be set to DAR for the station.  This will
      generally be VLBA or MKIV.  The fanout will then default as
      before, trying to achieve speedup factor 2.  The barrel roll
      will be turned off except for VLBA format stations. 12Jun97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed warning about missing BBC frequency in SETFREQ.  Before it
      claimed the BBSYN was there regardless of the truth.  25Jun97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added ISETSTA to schset.inc to keep a pointer from the setup
      group to the corresponding station catalog entry.  25Jun97.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Reorder the NAMES and VALUES arrays in KD in the KEYIN support
      routines.  This allows elimination of the EQUIVALENCE statements
      which works around the new SUN compiler bug.  It also somewhat
      simplifies the use of the routines.   25Jun97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>MAKESETUP, the program that makes the standard setup files from
      the Master_setups file, has received major revisions.  All
      setup files are now significantly different, taking advantage
      of the new abilities of SCHED to default stations, bbcs etc.
      26jun97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Made IFCHAN = R, L work with the frequency catalog as an
      alternative to POL.  1 July 97. RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Set up so default fan outs cause different setups to use the
      same number of tracks.  This should help users trying to mix
      bit rates with two tape modes, not to mention other modes.
      8Jul97 RCW

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tape summary in .sum file did not always reflect actual
      tape change times if SCHED was able to start during preceeding
      no-tape-motion scans.  Fixed 8Jul97  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allowing setup to match with a specified IF that matches ALTIFC.
      (bug fix).  14Jul1997 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Documented SUMITEM=SLEW.  Fixed bug in summary where the "up"
      flag for AZ2 was actually for the start of scan.  Thanks to
      Huib for finding these.  14Jul1997  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make anything that starts with VLBA in the frequency file
      match any setup file station that starts with VLBA.
      15Jul97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Block tracks assignments that won't work for polarization
      processing on the Socorro correlator (only if that correlator
      is specified in the header stuff).  Also try to prevent
      16 track barrel roll for data that will want the 2K FFT.
      18 July 1997 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Set up for 512 Mbps mode using 2 tapes at the VLBA or 2 heads
      on Mark IV systems.  The Mark IV implementation is not yet
      complete.  SCHED treats the second tape/head as just more
      heads.  The tapes are kept in sync in an extension of the
      prohibition of changes of numbers of tracks in use.
      17 July 1997.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow user to only specify one <TT>NETSIDE</TT> if they are all
      the same.  18Jul97 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Allow POL='R' or 'L' in addition to 'RCP' and 'LCP'.
      18Jul1997 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Make thin, high density tape the default for all cases.
      21Jul1997 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When setting the default pcal tone detection frequencies for
      observations with wide channel bandwidths, use the second or
      third one from the upper edge of the band for second one
      selected.  Previously, SCHED&nbsp; chose the highest tone
      available.  But this was often on the steep dropoff part
      of the filters and did not work very well.  21Jul1997 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix problem with defaulting of station names in setup files.
      When several were specified per group, and then another
      group with fewer was specified, some names could carry over.
      21Jul1997 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add to comments in opttim.f to warn that PRESCAN may be the
      problem if the user winds up with a zero length scan.
      21Jul1997 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Abort if the number of spectral channels requested with
      polarization processing exceeds 128 per baseband.
      21Jul1997 RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Try to account better for S2 tape needs by adding up to
      3 minutes between scans (2.5 before, 0.5 after).
      22Jul1995

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change to new IF scheme for VLA now that the computer controlled
      patch panel is available.  Now VLA IF A is routed to VLBA
      IF A and so forth.  28Jul97  RCW.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Upgraded VEX section to 1.5.44. 31Jul97 Huib.
<BR>
Changed to ``adaptive'' tape modes, enabling continuous tape
      motion (this enhancement can be switched off by setting
      VXADPT=.FALSE. in vxlink.inc and recompile). 
<BR>
Set needed flags to keep FS timing happy. 
<BR>
Support NOREC by seeting drive = 0 in scans. 
<BR>
Give proper message for use of plug-in filters. 
<BR>
Stop identical station codes. 
<BR>
31 July 1997   Huib.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Changed maximum correlator output data rate (VLBA correlator) from
      350 kbps to 500 kbps reflecting a recent increase in capability.
      31 July 1997.  RCW.
