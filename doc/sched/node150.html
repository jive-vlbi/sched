<TT>PEAK</TT> and <TT>NOPEAK</TT>
</H3>

<P>
<TT>PEAK</TT>, if specified, will cause commands to be issued to tell
some antennas to peak up their pointing.  <TT>NOPEAK</TT> causes
SCHED&nbsp; to stop issuing those commands.

<P>
For Green Bank (NRAO type files), ``cards'' will be issued that
request that the antenna peak up on source. This will happen for any
<TT>PEAK</TT> argument greater than or equal to zero. It can be turned
off by setting a negative argument or by specifying <TT>NOPEAK</TT>.
The peak takes about 5 minutes in addition to slew time on the 140'.

<P>
As of March 1999, <TT>PEAK</TT> is no longer used to control VLA
pointing.  Please see parameter <A HREF="node203.html#MP:VLAPEAK"><TT>VLAPEAK</TT></A>.

<P>
For the VLBA, if <TT>PEAK</TT> is greater than <TT>0</TT>, a peakup will be
done using the channel number specified by the <TT>PEAK</TT> argument.
The peakup begins either when the scan starts, or when the antenna
reaches the source, whichever is later.  But the on-line system will
wait for a maximum of 30 or 40 seconds to reach source before giving
up. If it will take longer than that to reach source, a dummy scan or
a gap between scans should be inserted. The peakup routine reads the
total power after being on each position for 2 seconds and then goes
on to the next position. The pattern contains 10 points. Therefore the
peakup will take 20 seconds plus slew times which may be as little as
30 seconds - call it 45 seconds to be conservative - at high
frequencies. It could take significantly longer at low frequencies but
there is no good reason to use reference pointing there. After the
peakup is done, the results will be used until either another peakup
is done or the project code changes.  Hopefully, we'll have some way
to turn it off eventually.

<P>
It will be common to peak up at a different frequency from that being
used for observing (eg peak at 7mm for 3mm observations).  It will
also be common to peak on a line source during a continuum
observation.  Therefore a different setup file will be needed for the
peaking scans.  It is reasonable to use the standard pointing setup
files.  They have names like <I>pt7mm.set</I>.  They use <TT>FORMAT=NONE</TT> which causes the on-line system on the VLBA to
not touch the formatter.  Note that this is very likely to mean
that any pulse cal data gathered during such scans are likely to
be spurious.

<P>
See the section on <A HREF="node37.html#SEC:REFPOINT">reference pointing</A> for
much more information on easy ways to insert pointing scans.

<P>
This command has no effect on the VEX file, there is currently no
means to peak up telescopes that are controlled through the PCFS.
