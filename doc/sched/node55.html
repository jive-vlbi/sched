<TT>AUTOTAPE</TT>
</H3>

<P>
<TT>AUTOTAPE</TT> is used to request that automatic tape allocation and
control be used at stations that use the VLBA control system and have
more than one tape drive.  It has no effect on other stations such as
those that use VEX or on VLBA controlled stations with only one tape
drive.  <TT>AUTOTAPE=1</TT> or <TT>AUTOTAPE=2</TT> causes the on-line system
to determine the tape direction, head position and track allocation
automatically. The schedules will only include instructions on whether
to run, stop, or rewind. <TT>AUTOTAPE&gt;=2</TT> also activates automatic
reversal of the tapes when the low tape mark is reached, even in the
middle of scans; with <TT>AUTOTAPE=1</TT> the tape will stop at the low
tape point and wait for the next scan. The default action (any other
value of <TT>AUTOTAPE</TT> including no value) is to have SCHED&nbsp; 
determine the tape motion and related information.

<P>
Automatic tape allocation is now required for most VLBA observations.
<TT>AUTOTAPE=2</TT> should therefore be specified in most schedules.
<TT>AUTOTAPE=1</TT> is risky and probably should not be used.  It is
provided only so that SCHED&nbsp; can create schedules for all modes
that the on-line systems can handle.

<P>
Automatic tape allocation cannot be used for projects that will not
be correlated on the VLBA correlator.  SCHED&nbsp; will refuse to make
such schedules.  This relates to how the correlators learn how the
tape was handled at the stations.  Non-VLBA correlators generally
obtain some of the tape positioning information from the schedules
rather than the logs, and, with automatic allocation, the two
can be very different.

<P>
When automatic tape allocation is specified (<TT>AUTOTAPE=2</TT>), any
station that is using the automatic allocation will be removed from a
scan if the source is below the hardware limits at both ends of the
scan.  One can tell when this happened because a ``<TT>D</TT>'' will
appear next to the <TT>--</TT> in the summary file elevation and azimuth
for a scan where this happened.  There is no override.  If one is
need, let Craig Walker know and it can be added.  This function
will mainly affect the Mauna Kea VLBA site which is often scheduled
in scans before the source rises and which has long access times
for the site techs doing tape changes.

<P>
For more information on how automatic tape handling works, see the
<A HREF="node27.html#SSSEC:AUTOTAPE">AUTOMATIC TAPE ALLOCATION</A> section.

<P>
The rest of this section concerns the use of <TT>AUTOTAPE</TT> for
the Mark&nbsp;II system.  It can be ignored by most (all?) current
users.

<P>
For Mark II, <TT>AUTOTAPE</TT> requests automatic tape changes.  Without
it, tape changes must be explicitly specified.  The value specified
for <TT>AUTOTAPE</TT>, if there is one, should be a time.  The default,
if no argument is given, is <TT>4:00:00</TT>, which is the recommended
value.  Specify a negative number to turn off tape changes and a
positive number (a time) to change the default tape length.  Tape
changes are requested at intervals of the requested time beginning
with the earliest start time of the whole schedule. If this would
require a change in the middle of a scan, the change is moved to the
start of the scan and all following changes are moved up. This is
station dependent and so can cause non-simultaneous tape changes. The
tape is assumed to be kept moving between scans.

<P>
The reference time for <TT>AUTOTAPE</TT> (Mark&nbsp;II use) can be altered
with <TT>TPREF</TT> in the SCHED&nbsp; keyin file and with the <TT>TPTIME</TT>
in the <TT>TAPEFILE</TT>. See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node198.html#SEC:TPINI">3.4</A> for information on
<TT>TPTIME</TT>. <TT>TPREF</TT> is a time of the form <TT>hh:mm:ss</TT>. The
automatic tape changes are requested at integral numbers of 4 hour
intervals (for the recommended time) before or after <TT>TPREF</TT>. A
date is not needed because 4 hours divides 24 hours evenly. Even if
someone were to use the 2 or 6 hour VCR modes, those tape lengths
still divide 24 hours evenly.

<P>
If <TT>TAPE</TT> is specified in a Mark&nbsp;II schedule for a scan while <TT>AUTOTAPE</TT> is set, a tape change will be requested and following tape
changes will occur at 4 hour intervals from the time of the forced
change. One specification of <TT>TAPE</TT> is usually all that is needed
to get the tape changing sequence right if the earliest start time is
a poor reference time.

<P>
For most Mark&nbsp;II projects, the default action of <TT>AUTOTAPE</TT> should
be good. The major exceptions are projects that start on the half hour
and tape changes are desired on the hour, and projects where it makes
sense to have a short tape at the start on some stations to avoid
short tape on other stations for which the source rises later. Both of
these cases can be handled nicely with <TT>TPREF</TT>.

<P>
Note that for Mark&nbsp;II observations, if <TT>AUTOTAPE</TT> is turned off,
no initial tape mount at the start of the project will be requested.
This causes problems at some stations. It you insist on specifying all
tape changes with <TT>TAPE</TT>, be sure to put one on the first scan for
each station. This mode of setting tape changes is NOT recommended.
