Keyin Free-format Input
</H1>

<P>
All input parameters to SCHED&nbsp; are in the keyin free format, named
after Tim Pearson's subroutine that is used to read it. The important
features of that format for SCHED&nbsp; are described here. This
description is not complete and users of the Caltech package
should refer to other documentation for useful capabilities of keyin
input that are not normally used for SCHED.

<P>
Input via keyin format is of the form <TT>keyword = value</TT>. Different
sets of <TT>keywords</TT> and <TT>values</TT> are separated by spaces or line
breaks. The equal sign is optional as long as its absence does not
lead to ambiguity.  The input <TT>keywords</TT> are not case sensitive.
Most of the <TT>values</TT> required by SCHED, except for file
names in case sensitive systems like unix, are also not case
sensitive.  <TT>keywords</TT> are, in all cases, limited to 8 characters
in length.  Character string <TT>values</TT> can be much longer.

<P>
A few SCHED&nbsp; <TT>keywords</TT> may be abbreviated.  In the parameter
descriptions in this manual, the required characters will be shown in
upper case while the optional ones will be shown in lower case.  Any
characters beyond the required ones must match the optional ones.  As
an example, the <TT>keyword DURation</TT> can be typed as <TT>DUR, dur,
DURATION, duration, durat, Dur ....</TT>.

<P>
A <TT>value</TT> can be an array, with elements of the array separated by
commas. If the last character on a line is a comma, the input array is
assumed to continue on the next line.

<P>
The <TT>value</TT> can be a number or a character string.  Quotation
marks are required for a character string if it can be mistaken for a
number or if it contains blanks or commas.  Also, because of possible
ambiguity with other <TT>keywords</TT>, character string <TT>values</TT>
must be in quotes if the equal sign is left out.

<P>
If the <TT>value</TT> is a number, the decimal point and fractional part are
optional.  The parser converts all numbers to double precision real so
the program will not know if you specify ``5'' or ``5.0'' etc.  The
value can be an arithmetic expression enclosed in parentheses.  An
example would be <TT>(5.5*4)</TT>.  The expression cannot contain
blanks or the parser will get confused.

<P>
If <TT>value</TT> is a time or angle, it can be written in <TT>hh:mm:ss.ss</TT> or <TT>dd:mm:ss.ss</TT> format. Each colon causes all values
to the left to be multiplied by 60, giving a result to the program
that is in seconds. Values less than an hour or degree can be written
<TT>mm:ss.ss</TT> or just <TT>ss.ss</TT>. The decimal and fractional seconds
are optional.  However, even hours or degrees require the colons; for
example, 2 degrees is written as 2:0:0. Numbers larger then 60 are
allowed for the minutes and seconds; for example, 2:40 and 160 are
equivalent.  No imbedded blanks or signs are allowed.  A negative
or positive sign is allowed in front and applies to the final total
number of seconds (ie. -1:20 is returned as -80).

<P>
A <TT>keyword</TT> can be specified without a value. This is equivalent,
as far as the program knows, to specifying a value of zero. Some <TT>keywords</TT> are used in this way as logical switches to cause something
to happen. <TT>DOVEX</TT>, <TT>DOPPLER</TT>, and <TT>PTVLBA</TT> are examples from
SCHED. Usually the effect of such a switch can be reversed by
specifying a non-zero value.  For several such switches, SCHED&nbsp; 
has a corresponding variable <TT>keyword</TT> that has the opposite effect
(for example: <A HREF="node167.html#MP:RECORD"><TT>RECord</TT></A> and <A HREF="node167.html#MP:RECORD"><TT>NORECord</TT></A>).

<P>
An exclamation mark (``!'') causes all items on the rest of the line
to be ignored. This is useful for adding comments.

<P>
The parser collects all input, regardless of how many lines it is on,
up to the line on which it finds the ``Endmark'', which in the case of
SCHED&nbsp; and most other programs is a ``/'' .  For SCHED, these
groups correspond to scans in the main input, or a station or a source
in the main catalogs.

<P>
Some examples of valid, if not very consistent, SCHED&nbsp; input are:

<P>
<PRE>
  SOURCE='0235+164'  YEar = 1988  day 67  Stat = 'OVRO',NRAO,
   vla,vlba_pt  stop 03:35:00  dur = 15:00
  comment 'Quotes are needed for more than one word.'  /
</PRE>

<P>
When a program that uses keyin is run interactively, the user can
obtain a list of inputs by typing ``<TT>HELP /</TT>'' and can obtain a list of
the current values of all input variables by typing ``<TT>SHOW /</TT>''.
The input of SCHED&nbsp; is rarely, if ever, given interactively.

<P>
Keyin values can be mathematical statements in parenthesis; for
example,
<PRE>
  dur = 15
  rep = (4*5)
</PRE>
This example shows the most likely way in which this capability might
be used in SCHED&nbsp; input files.  These two commands mean that
the scan, which is 15 seconds long, should be repeated 20 times.
By using the <TT>(4*5)</TT>, it makes it clear that the repetition
lasts for 5 minutes since there are 4 scans per minute.
