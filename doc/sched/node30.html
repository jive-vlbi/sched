MARK5 and EVLBI 
</H2>

<P>
The Mark5 disk-based system is rapidly replacing the various tape
based VLBI recording systems.  It is likely that tape will no longer
be in widespread use beyond 2006.  This system is a major advance on
many fronts including scheduling.  Once fully deployed, schedulers
should be able to ignore the recording system other than making sure
that they are not scheduling to record more data than can fit on the
disk space that they have been allocated.  There should no longer be
concerns about tape passes, tape changes, allowed mixing of modes and
all the rest of the issues that affected tapes.

<P>
SCHED&nbsp; supports Mark5 on the VLBA by including the required commands
in the telescope control files (the <I>crd</I> files).  For systems
controled by the Field System (PCFS), SCHED&nbsp; writes a <TT>.skd</TT> file
in VEX format with the necessary commands to control Mark5.  The Mark5A
system is meant as a plug replacement for MarkIV or VLBA tape recorders.
It still records the same tracks that would be recorded on a tape
systems so SCHED&nbsp; must still be aware of management of such issues.
The Mark5B system will take the output of the samplers through a VSI
interface.  All formatting issues are dealt with transparently by
the recording system.

<P>
There will be a period of transition between tape and disk systems.
During that period, it will be necessary to specify which recording
system is to be used at each station.  This will likely necessitate
that schedules will be rerun shortly before observing, at least for
dynamically scheduled VLBA programs, using the latest station catalog
or tapeini section.

<P>
There are a few controls needed to schedule Mark5.  First, the
<A HREF="node197.html#SEC:STACAT">station catalog</A> must show that the station has a
disk system.  That is done with the <TT>DISK</TT> keyword.  This is
separate from the <TT>RECORDER</TT> keyword to allow a station entry to
cover both tape and disk systems during the transition period.  There
is a station catalog keyword <TT>MEDIADEF</TT> that sets the default
medium to use at each station.  SCHED&nbsp; will use that default in the
absence of an overriding <TT>MEDIA</TT> command in the <A HREF="node179.html#MP:TAPEINI"><TT>TAPEINI</TT></A> section.  Schedulers for most VLBA observations
should probably ignore the problem and let operations deal with
getting the recording system right by rerunning SCHED&nbsp; just before
the observations.  For EVN and Global sessions, it should be clear
before the session which system will be used.

<P>
As of 02 Oct. 2004, the version of the VEX code that is set up to
support Mark5 is not released.  The current version of SCHED&nbsp; can be
told to write a Mark5 VEX file, but only if the parameter
<A HREF="node187.html#MP:VEXTEST"><TT>VEXTEST</TT></A> is specified.

<P>
The examples <I>egmk5vlba.key</I> and <I>egmk5vex.key</I> show how to
set up Mark5 observations.

<P>
Eventually SCHED&nbsp; will support VLBI over networks.  This can involve
real time correlation in which case the data are routed
directly to the Network.  Perhaps more likely for a while is what
might be called ftp VLBI.  In this case, the data are recorded at
the station, then read back through the Network.  There are a few
new parameters meant to help control eVLBI observation, but they
don't yet do much <TT>DATAPATH, GRABTO, GRABTIME, GRABGAP</TT>.
