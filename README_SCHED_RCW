These are instructions to create, manage, and delete a svn branch
and related work areas for SCHED where I can freely use commits of partially
complete stuff for moving between the AOC and home without affecting 
the usability of the main trunk area.

Some instructions from red-bean.com manual, much condensed.

*** Before doing anything, be sure the branch and trunk are updated.

While using the branch, set
setenv SCHED /users/cwalker/files/sched_rcw/sched

In the following the ^ refers to https://svn.aoc.nrao.edu/repos/sched
That is set automatically somehow.
------------------------------------------
To create the branch:
setenv SCHED /users/cwalker/files/sched_work
cd $SCHED
svn update
svn copy ^/trunk  ^/branches/sched_rcw \
  -m "Creating branch for local development"

That creates ^/branches/sched_rcw/sched which contains the sched files
corresponding to ^/trunk/sched
------------------------------------------
To create a working area for the branch (At AOC.  Something similar elsewhere):
cd /users/cwalker/files/
svn checkout https://svn.aoc.nrao.edu/repos/sched/branches/sched_rcw

To test, set:
setenv SCHED /users/cwalker/files/sched_rcw/sched
------------------------------------------
To pull in anything from trunk that was committed after the split:
The merge updates the working copy.
Then commit to put into the scn branch.
cd to the sched_rcw area.
svn merge ^/trunk -m "Updating changes in trunk to branch"
TEST
svn commit
------------------------------------------
To sync back to sched_work:

Make sure trunk is up to date, and committed.
setenv SCHED /users/cwalker/files/sched
cd $SCHED
svn update
svn status -u
svn commit     (if needed)

First update the branch work area with the trunk modifications, and test.
Note that the 

setenv $SCHED /users/cwalker/files/sched_rcw/sched
cd $SCHED
svn update
svn merge ^/trunk/sched
TEST the build.
svn status -u
svn commit     (if needed)

Now "reintegrate" the branch with trunk:
setenv SCHED /users/cwalker/files/sched_work
cd $SCHED
svn merge --reintegrate ^/branches/sched_rcw/sched
#  Might --dry-run the above first.
#  TEST
svn commit   (if needed - probably will be)

Got:  System's issue, I think.
noatak<396>% svn merge --dry-run --reintegrate ^/branches/sched_rcw/sched
svn: Querying mergeinfo requires version 3 of the FSFS filesystem schema; filesystem '/home/asg/svn/sched/db' uses only version 2

I think I'm giving up on this for now.  Mar. 15, 2015.

The reintegrated branch can no longer be used normally, so it
is best to delete it and make a new one if one is wanted.
To delete the branch, if desired:
Also need to delete the working copy (I think).

svn delete ^/sched/branches/sched_rcw -m "get rid of rcw branch"
cd /users/files/sched_rcw
chmod -R a+w *
/usr/bin -R *

Then recreate it as above if desired to use it more.  This sounds
mainly worthwhile for big projects.
