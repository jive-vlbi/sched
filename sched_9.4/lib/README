This directory contains a few subroutine libraries that have been
imported to SCHED but which are not recreated by the makefile.

The LINUX NAIF libraries are here.  Note that there are 32bit (LINUX)
and 64bit (LINUX64) versions, and there may eventually need to be
gfortran versions.  The code and tools for recreating these libraries
are in sched_NAIF in the same directory as sched_work.


I may put the pgplot libraries here someday.
