Version 8.0 of SCHED was released on Dec. 14, 2008.

This release contains many updates made over the more than two years
since the last release.  Most changes are relatively minor.  More
changes are expected soon as we move to digital backends and Mark5B
and Mark5C so expect additional updates in the next few months.

For details, see the release notes in the manual
(http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~cwalker/sched/sched/sched.html).
Some sample items in the release are:

Many changes in code and documentation reflect the switch from tape to
disk.  This especially affects the manual as many of the code changes
were in the previous version.

Changes to support the EVLA have started to appear including the
ability to set frequencies outside the old VLA bands, the ability to
mix phased array and single dish observations, the ability to specify
the correlator integration time, the ability to specify the reference
antenna (you shouldn't need this), and freq.dat entries for 5cm
methanol and OH lines.  Some unused features were removed.  There will
be much more in this area as the project progresses.

Examples for HSA observations have been added.

A 24GHz band was added for observations at 23.8 GHz  - away from 
the atmospheric water line.  At least on the VLBA where the receivers
were upgraded recently, this can be noticably more sensitive than
the usual 22.2 GHz default (which is still available).

It is now the default to produce VEX output files.  This is in
preparation for their use on the VLBA software correlator.  A few
types of observations are not supported in the SCHED VEX code and, for
them, DOVEX=-1 must be specified to turn off the VEX output.  These
mostly involve observations of moving objects like satellites.

The station and source catalogs are now based on the 2008a_astro
solution from GSFC.

SCHED is now distributed in a single gzipped tar file containing all
code, examples, and catalogs.  The binaries are available separately.
The release is available from anonymous ftp at ftp.aoc.nrao.edu in
subdirectory pub/sched/sched_8.0.  The tar file is there.  The
binaries subdirectory contains machine specific subdirectories
containing the provided executables.  Note that the LINUX version is
for 32 bit machines.  The LINUX64SPICE version contains spacecraft
tracking code that will not be of interest to most people.  Many users
should find that one of the binaries works for them.  If not, it is
not difficult to recompile based on what is in the tar file.  You will
need to recompile using the makefile.  Edit Makefile.master to
configure for your machine based on the comments in the file.  Call it
Makefile and run make.

Note that there are transitions going on between 32 and 64 bit
machines, between g77 and gfortran compilers in the GNU world, and
between PPC and Intel chips on the Mac side, so there is a
proliferation of binaries that might be needed.  We have not tried to
provide an exhaustive set.

Planetary motions are not supported in VEX in this version.  We hope
to change that soon.

SCHED is now under revision control with SVN.
