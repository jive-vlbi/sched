   Cells are SPICE data structures that are vectors of type double
   precision, integer, or character type carrying with them their own
   dimension and knowledge of how many components have been used.

<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   A ``cell array"' is an array dimensioned from LBCELL to CMAX, where
   LBCELL is the standard lower bound of a cell (currently -5) and CMAX is
   the maximum number of elements that the cell is allowed to contain at
   any one time---that is, the maximum cardinality of the cell.
<P>
 
   A ``cell"' is a cell array in which elements LBCELL through 0 contain
   information about whatever is stored in the rest of the array. CMAX is
   stored in this part of the cell, as is CCUR, the current cardinality of
   the cell. For character cells, these values are encoded into character
   strings. The SPICELIB cell's compact representation allows the user to
   declare, pass, and otherwise manipulate cells without having to keep
   track of separate pointers and dimensions for each cell array. Thus, a
   routine to merge the contents of two arrays into a third, when coded
   using cells, looks like this
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL MERGE ( OLD, NEW, TOTAL )
</PRE>
   instead of like this
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL MERGE ( OLD, N_OLD, NEW, N_NEW, MAX_TOTAL, TOTAL, N_TOTAL )
</PRE>
   This is especially convenient for arrays that need to be passed as
   arguments through several levels of subprograms. Frequently, such arrays
   are placed in common blocks to avoid the proliferation of pointers and
   dimensions in calling sequences. This also remedies one of the serious
   flaws in the implementation of Fortran arrays---the inability of a
   subprogram to determine the size of an argument array into which it is
   to place values. Since the size of a cell is always available,
   subroutines that manipulate cells can always check for overflow
   conditions.

<H2> Naming Conventions
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The type of a cell is the same as the type of the cell array. In
   general, cell routines come in groups of three, the last letter of which
   indicates the cell type. We will refer to the generic routines by
   substituting an ``x"' for the last letter. Thus, CARDx may be any of the
   following: <a href="../spicelib/cardc.html">CARDC</a>, <a href="../spicelib/cardd.html">CARDD</a>, or <a href="../spicelib/cardi.html">CARDI</a>. In specific contexts, we will use the
   specific names of routines. Before a cell can be used, it must be
   initialized. During initialization, the size is set to the maximum
   cardinality of the cell, the current cardinality is set to zero, and the
   remaining control information becomes undefined. A cell need be
   initialized only once, after which it may be used freely. (This assumes,
   of course, that routines which manipulate the cells remember to reset
   the cardinality when appropriate.)
<P>
 
   The subroutine SSIZEx is used to initialize a cell, as shown below.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   INTEGER          LBCELL
   PARAMETER      ( LBCELL = -5 )
 
   DOUBLE PRECISION X    ( LBCELL:100 )
   DOUBLE PRECISION TEMP ( LBCELL:100 )
    .
    .
 
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/ssized.html">SSIZED</a> ( 100, X    )
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/ssized.html">SSIZED</a> ( 100, TEMP )
</PRE>
   We strongly recommend that you use a parameter, LBCELL, to declare the
   lower bounds of cells, as shown above.

   SPICELIB cells may be populated using the APPNDx routines. These
   routines ``append'' a datum to a cell: they insert a specified data item
   into the lowest-indexed free slot in the data area of the cell array.
   The APPNDx routines automatically update the cell's cardinality to
   reflect the addition of the new datum.
<P>
 
   To append three double precision numbers onto an empty double precision
   cell, we could use the code fragment
<P>
 
<PRE>
   INTEGER            LBCELL
   PARAMETER        ( LBCELL = -5 )
 
   DOUBLE PRECISION   X ( LBCELL : 100 )
 
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/ssized.html">SSIZED</a> ( 100, X )
 
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/appndd.html">APPNDD</a> ( 0.D0, X )
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/appndd.html">APPNDD</a> ( 0.D0, X )
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/appndd.html">APPNDD</a> ( 1.D0, X )
</PRE>
   Another subroutine SCARDx is used to adjust the cardinality of a cell.
   This is necessary when directly inserting items into or removing items
   from a cell, as shown below.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/ssized.html">SSIZED</a> ( 100, X )
 
   X(1) = 0.D0
   X(2) = 0.D0
   X(3) = 1.D0
 
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/scardd.html">SCARDD</a> ( 3, X )
</PRE>
   SSIZEx and SCARDx should always be used in lieu of altering the contents
   of elements LBCELL through 0 directly.
<P>
 
   The subroutine COPYx copies the elements of one cell to another cell.
   This can be useful for modifying temporary or working cells, or for
   saving copies of cells which are about to be changed. For example,
<P>
 
<PRE>
   INTEGER            LBCELL
   PARAMETER        ( LBCELL = -5 )
 
   DOUBLE PRECISION   X    ( LBCELL : 100 )
   DOUBLE PRECISION   TEMP ( LBCELL : 100 )
 
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/ssized.html">SSIZED</a> ( 100, X    )
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/ssized.html">SSIZED</a> ( 100, TEMP )
 
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/copyd.html">COPYD</a> ( X, TEMP )
</PRE>
   copies the contents of X into TEMP. In this case, the cells are the same
   size (each can hold up to 100 elements), so the operation will always
   succeed. In general, if the output cell is not large enough to hold the
   contents of the input cell, as many elements as will fit are inserted
   into the output cell, and the SPICELIB error handling mechanism reports
   the number of excess elements.
<P>
 
   An extra check is performed by <a href="../spicelib/copyc.html">COPYC</a>, which copies character cells. In
   order to avoid truncation problems, <a href="../spicelib/copyc.html">COPYC</a> verifies that the operation
   can be performed without losing any of the non-blank characters in the
   original cell. The loss of one or more non-blank characters is reported
   through the SPICELIB error handling mechanism.
<P>
 
   The integer function CARDx returns the cardinality of a cell. This may
   be used to determine whether a cell is empty or not. (The cardinality of
   an empty cell is zero.) It may also be used to assist in accessing the
   elements of a cell individually, as in the following example.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   WRITE (6,*) 'Winners of the Nobel Prize for Physics:'
 
   DO I = 1, <a href="../spicelib/cardc.html">CARDC</a> ( NOBEL )
      WRITE (6,*) NOBEL(I)
   END DO
</PRE>
   The integer function SIZEx returns the size (maximum cardinality) of a
   cell. This is useful primarily for predicting situations in which
   overflow can occur, as in the following example.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   IF ( <a href="../spicelib/cardc.html">CARDC</a> ( WINNERS ) .LE. <a href="../spicelib/sizec.html">SIZEC</a> ( NOBEL ) ) THEN
      CALL <a href="../spicelib/copyc.html">COPYC</a> ( WINNERS, NOBEL )
   ELSE
     .
     .
     .
   END IF

   As we mentioned earlier, the size and cardinality of a cell are stored
   in the control area of the cell (elements LBCELL through 0). For numeric
   data types, this is accomplished by simple assignment. However, in the
   case of cell arrays of type character, the values for the size and
   cardinality must be encoded into character strings.
<P>
 
   This is done by storing the numbers in base CHBASE, where CHBASE is the
   number of distinct characters in the character set supported by the host
   machine and compiler. (In ASCII environments, CHBASE is always at least
   128, and may be as high as 256.) The numbers are encoded and decoded by
   subroutines <a href="../spicelib/enchar.html">ENCHAR</a> and <a href="../spicelib/dechar.html">DECHAR</a> respectively. The value of parameter
   MINLEN (declared in <a href="../spicelib/enchar.html">ENCHAR</a>) constrains the minimum length of the
   elements in a cell array. The nominal value for MINLEN is 5. Given this
   value,
<P>
 
<PRE>
   INTEGER          LBCELL
   PARAMETER      ( LBCELL = -5 )
 
   CHARACTER*5      NAMES    ( LBCELL:1000 )
</PRE>
   is a legal cell declaration, while
<P>
 
<PRE>
   INTEGER          LBCELL
   PARAMETER      ( LBCELL = -5 )
 
   CHARACTER*4      NAMES    ( LBCELL:1000 )
</PRE>
   is not.

<H2> Cell-based data types
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   SPICELIB contains several extended data types based on cells. For
   example, one family of routines uses cells to implement algebraic sets
   of all types (character, integer, double precision). Another uses double
   precision cells to manipulate collections of closed intervals of the
   real numbers, called windows.
<P>
 
   All of these data types are supported by routines designed to manipulate
   them. However, because they are based on cells, all of these data types
   can be manipulated by the general cell routines as well. Thus, COPYx can
   be used to copy sets and windows, just as it can be used to copy vanilla
   cells.
