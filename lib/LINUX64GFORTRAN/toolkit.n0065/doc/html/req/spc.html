   SPC routines deal with the comment area of binary kernel files based on
   the DAF architecture -- SPKs, CKs, binary PCKs.

<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Within the SPICE system, every kernel file may have its own internal
   documentation, called comments, that describe the type of data contained
   within the file, for example, its origin, pedigree, recommended use, and
   catalog information. These comments are internal to the file and thus
   attached to the data. However, the presence of comments does not
   interfere with the use of the data.
<P>
 
   The SPICE system contains three types of kernel files: sequential text
   kernel files and two types of direct access binary kernel files: DAF and
   DAS. You may comment text SPICE kernels simply by editing the files
   using any text editor.
<P>
 
   Usually the easiest way to comment DAF and DAS files is to use the SPICE
   program COMMNT, which is able to add, read, delete, or extract comments
   to or from a DAF or DAS file.
<P>
 
   User application programs can manipulate the comment area of a DAF-based
   binary format file---for example an SPK, binary PCK, or CK---by calling
   the family of subroutines described in this document.
<P>
 
   This SPC Required Reading is a supplement to the DAF Required Reading,
   <a href="../req/daf.html">daf.req</a>.

<A NAME="The Comment Area"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> The Comment Area
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   SPK, binary PCK, and CK files are instances of the SPICELIB Double
   Precision Array File (DAF). Typically, you need know little about DAFs
   when reading these files using their associated reader subroutines or
   when accessing the comment area using the SPC subroutines. However, we
   briefly introduce DAF here in order to explain the comment area. For
   additional information about the DAF architecture and its associated
   subroutines, refer to the DAF Required Reading, <a href="../req/daf.html">daf.req</a>.
<P>
 
   A DAF is a direct access FORTRAN 77 file which is organized into five
   types of physical records.
<P>
 
   One of the DAF record types is a ``comment record.'' (These were
   referred to in some older documentation as ``reserved records.'')
   Comment records store lines of text. We call this text ``comments,'' and
   the comment records themselves are the physical area of the file that we
   call the ``comment area.''
<P>
 
   A DAF may contain any number of comment records, and there are DAF
   subroutines that add and remove comment records.
<P>
 
   The following restrictions apply to the comment area of a DAF:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The comment area may contain ONLY text (printable ASCII characters, namely
ASCII 32-126).
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The maximum line length in the comment area should not exceed 80
characters. If you abide by this rule, your commented DAF files will be
portable to practically any computer platform.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The SPICELIB routine <a href="../spicelib/spcac.html">SPCAC</a> is the ONLY routine that you may use to store
comments in a DAF.
<BR><BR></UL>
   While the purpose of this document is not to define the kind of
   information that these comments should include, the following
   suggestions may be helpful.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Comments in a file should provide summary and pedigree information that
would assist users of that data, or should at least include a pointer to
that information, such as the name and address of a person who knows it.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Where possible, comments should be in a well-defined parseable format such
as the ``keyword = value'' syntax used by JPL's Spaceflight Operations
Center (SFOC) and Planetary Data System (PDS). Before commenting a file,
think about how you or some other user may want to process that
information.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Comments should be consistent from file to file. For example, the same
keyword should have the same meaning in each file, and two different
keywords should not have the same meaning.
<BR><BR></UL>

<A NAME="Accessing the Comment Area"></A>

<H2> Accessing the Comment Area
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The following five SPICELIB subroutines may be used to access the
   comment area of a DAF:

   The term ``text file'' used above and throughout this document, refers
   to a file containing only printable ASCII characters (ASCII 32-126). You
   may create such a file with a standard text editor such as EDT, EVE, or
   TPU on a VAX, vi or emacs on a UNIX system, or EDIT on a MS/DOS system,
   but remember not to put in tabs or other non-printable characters.
   Alternatively, you may create a text file with a FORTRAN program that
   first calls the SPICELIB routine TXTOPN to open the file and then writes
   printable character data to it. A file created using a word processor
   such as Word Perfect or MacWord would likely not be suitable; these
   files usually contain hidden control characters.
<P>
 
   The term ``text file'' should not be confused with references to a
   transfer format SPK or CK kernel file found elsewhere in this or other
   NAIF Toolkit documentation.
<P>
 
   Descriptions of how to add, extract, delete, and read comments below are
   followed by an extensive pictorial example plus examples of typical
   usage of these subroutines. Also, the NAIF Toolkit utility program
   COMMNT performs the functions that are illustrated in the examples;
   refer to the COMMNT User's Guide, <a href="../ug/commnt.html">commnt.ug</a>, for details.
<P>

<A NAME="Adding comments"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Adding comments
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Use <a href="../spicelib/spcac.html">SPCAC</a> to add comments to a binary SPK or CK file from an existing
   text file. If the binary SPK or CK file is not open for write access,
   use the SPICELIB routine <a href="../spicelib/dafopw.html">DAFOPW</a> to open it. Also, if the text file is
   not open for read access, open it using TXTOPR. Then pass the DAF file's
   HANDLE and the text file's UNIT to <a href="../spicelib/spcac.html">SPCAC</a>:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/spcac.html">SPCAC</a> ( HANDLE, UNIT, BMARK, EMARK )
</PRE>
   The calling sequence above also includes a character string begin
   marker, BMARK, and an end marker, EMARK. The lines of the text file
   located between BMARK and EMARK are those that <a href="../spicelib/spcac.html">SPCAC</a> adds to the comment
   area. Specifically, the following rules apply to the use of these
   markers:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The first line of comments to be added to the binary file is the line that
follows the first line of the file equivalent to BMARK (if BMARK is not a
blank string).
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The last line of comments to be added to the binary file is the line that
precedes the next line of the text file equivalent to EMARK (if EMARK is
not a blank string).
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Leading and trailing blanks are ignored when testing for equivalence.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> If BMARK is a blank string, then the first line of comments to be added to
the binary file is the first line of the text file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> If EMARK is a blank string, then the last line of comments to be added to
the binary file is the last line of the text file.
<BR><BR></UL>
   If the comment area of the binary file already has some comments from a
   previous call to <a href="../spicelib/spcac.html">SPCAC</a>, the new comments are appended to the previous
   comments with a blank line in between. <a href="../spicelib/spcac.html">SPCAC</a> creates space in the file
   for the additional comments as needed.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Extracting comments"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Extracting comments
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   <a href="../spicelib/spcec.html">SPCEC</a> extracts the comments from the comment area of the binary DAF and
   writes them to a text file. If the binary file is not open for read
   access, open it using <a href="../spicelib/dafopr.html">DAFOPR</a>. If a text file isn't open for write
   access, open one with TXTOPN. Then pass the HANDLE and UNIT to <a href="../spicelib/spcec.html">SPCEC</a>:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/spcec.html">SPCEC</a> ( HANDLE, UNIT )
</PRE>
   <a href="../spicelib/spcec.html">SPCEC</a> does not modify the comment area; it just copies its contents to a
   text file. For this reason, the binary DAF need only be open for read
   access.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Deleting comments"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Deleting comments
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   <a href="../spicelib/spcdc.html">SPCDC</a> deletes everything in the comment area of the binary DAF. It
   requires the handle of the binary file which has been opened for write
   access.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/spcdc.html">SPCDC</a> ( HANDLE )
</PRE>
   Deleting comments does not reduce the physical size of the file, but
   does make that space available for adding more comments or additional
   data arrays.

<A NAME="Reading comments line by line"></A>

<H3> Reading comments line by line

   If you wish to examine the contents of the comment area of a DAF
   directly without writing them to a file, use <a href="../spicelib/spcrfl.html">SPCRFL</a> and <a href="../spicelib/spcrnl.html">SPCRNL</a>. SPCRFL
   takes the handle of the binary file, opened with read access, and
   returns the first line of comments. <a href="../spicelib/spcrnl.html">SPCRNL</a> may then be called
   repetitively to return subsequent lines of comments from that same file.
   Both routines have an argument EOC that has the logical value .TRUE.
   when the end-of-comments has been reached.

   why it was created. We can run the NAIF utility program called SPACIT to
   summarize the data and display the comments. Suppose the comments
   consist of the following:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   SOURCE = John Smith, JPL, ph. (818) 354-1234
   FILE ID = 9999
</PRE>
   These comments do not answer our questions directly, but we can call
   John Smith, and he can provide the needed information. Suppose we do
   call John Smith and he gives us the following information which we type
   into a text file called MORE.TXT:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   DATE_OF_CREATION = 1990 Nov 10
   PURPOSE = Ephemeris generated for use during Galileo Earth flyby
   SOURCE = Includes TCM-8 data and DE-125.
</PRE>
   We can put this new information into the comment area of A.BSP,
   appending it to the comments that are already there with the following
   program. Note that the NAIF Toolkit utility program COMMNT provides this
   same functionality.

<H3> Example of how to search through Comment Areas
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   If you have several DAFs, all with comments containing keyword and value
   labels of consistent format, it is a simple task to search through the
   files for a particular keyword and compare the value associated with
   that keyword from each file.
<P>
 
   The following subroutine called GETVAL takes the name of a file and a
   keyword. It searches for that keyword in the comment area of the file
   and returns the value associated with it. The keyword and value are
   assumed to be on a single line and separated by an equal sign.

   We wish to compare these two dates from the two files to see which file
   was created earlier so the program can load the most recently created
   file last. (Last loaded files get searched first by SPK reader
   subroutines). The following code fragment accomplishes the task, using

<H3> Example of how to edit comments
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Another example of typical usage of the SPC subroutines is when we have
   an SPK or CK file with comments and we want to edit those comments.
   (This functionality is included in the COMMNT program.)
<P>
 
   First we must extract the comments to a text file. Suppose we have a
   binary CK file called PLATFORM.BC. The following program extracts the
   comments to a text file called COMMENTS.TXT.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   INTEGER      HANDLE
   INTEGER      UNIT
 
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/dafopr.html">DAFOPR</a> ( 'PLATFORM.BC',  HANDLE )
   CALL TXTOPN ( 'COMMENTS.TXT', UNIT   )
 
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/spcec.html">SPCEC</a>  ( HANDLE, UNIT )
 
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/dafcls.html">DAFCLS</a> ( HANDLE )
   CLOSE ( UNIT )
   END
</PRE>
   Suppose the comment text extracted into the file COMMENTS.TXT is as
   shown below.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   DATE_OF_CREATION = 1991 JAN 3
 
   PURPOSE = Painting data for the scan platform
</PRE>
   Using a standard text editor, we edit COMMENTS.TXT. We remove a blank
   line, add three lines, and fix a spelling error. The final contents are
   the following.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   DATE_OF_UPDATE = 1991 MAR 12
   REASON_FOR_UPDATE = Minor revision to comment area
   DATE_OF_CREATION = 1991 JAN 3
   PURPOSE = Pointing data for the scan platform
   SOURCE = Jane Doe, JPL, ph. (818) 354-1234
</PRE>
   Finally, we run the following program to delete the old comments from
   the CK file and add the revised set of comments.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   INTEGER      HANDLE
   INTEGER      UNIT
 
   CALL <a href="../spicelib/dafopw.html">DAFOPW</a> ( 'PLATFORM.BC',  HANDLE )

   The differences between this document and the previous July, 1994
   version are summarized below.
<P>
 
   This document originally discussed the SPICE API for manipulating the
   comment areas of binary SPK and CK files. The abbreviation SPC was
   derived from the letters SP and C which respectively designated these
   kernel types. The functionality of these routines has been extended (by
   fiat) to apply to all SPICE DAF-based files, but the SPC acronym has
   been retained.
<P>
 
   Since the last release of this document, NAIF has decided that all DAF
   files will treat their reserved record areas as a comment area. The
   comment area access functions provided by the routines discussed here
   now apply to all DAF files, not just SPK and CK files. Accordingly,
   references to SPK and CK have been replaced by references to DAF as
   needed.
<P>
 
   Incidentally, NAIF has since developed another DAF-based kernel type:
   the binary PCK. As a DAF, the comment area of a binary PCK may be
   accessed by the SPC routines.
<P>
 
   Note that E-kernels are not based on the DAF architecture; their comment
   areas cannot be accessed by the SPC routines.
<P>
 
   The quotation style has been changed from British to American.
<P>
 
   Various other minor corrections have been made.
