     TRGPOS      is the fixed (constant) geometric position of a
                 target relative to its &quot;center of motion&quot; TRGCTR,
                 expressed in the reference frame TRGREF. 

                 Units are always km.


     TRGCTR      is the name of the center of motion of TRGPOS. The
                 ephemeris of TRGCTR is provided by loaded SPK files.

                 Optionally, you may supply the integer ID code for
                 the object as an integer string. For example both
                 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate
                 the moon is the center of motion.

                 Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
                 significant in the string TRGCTR.


     TRGREF      is the name of the reference frame relative to which
                 the input position TRGPOS is expressed. The target has
                 constant position relative to its center of motion 
                 in this reference frame.

                 Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
                 significant in the string TRGREF.


     ET          is the ephemeris time at which the state of the
                 target relative to the observer is to be
                 computed. ET is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.
                 ET refers to time at the observer's location.


     OUTREF      is the name of the reference frame with respect to
                 which the output state is expressed.

                 When OUTREF is time-dependent (non-inertial), its
                 orientation relative to the J2000 frame is evaluated
                 in the manner commanded by the input argument REFLOC
                 (see description below).

                 Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
                 significant in the string OUTREF.
 

     REFLOC      is a string indicating the output reference frame
                 evaluation locus: this is the location associated
                 with the epoch at which this routine is to evaluate
                 the orientation, relative to the J2000 frame, of the
                 output frame OUTREF. The values and meanings of
                 REFLOC are:

                    'OBSERVER'  Evaluate OUTREF at the observer's
                                epoch ET.

                                Normally the locus 'OBSERVER' should
                                be selected when OUTREF is centered
                                at the observer.


                    'TARGET'    Evaluate OUTREF at the target epoch;
                                letting LT be the one-way light time 
                                between the target and observer, the
                                target epoch is

                                   ET-LT  if reception aberration
                                          corrections are used

                                   ET+LT  if transmission aberration
                                          corrections are used

                                   ET     if no aberration corrections
                                          are used

                                Normally the locus 'TARGET' should
                                be selected when OUTREF is TRGREF,
                                the frame in which the target position
                                is specified.


                    'CENTER'    Evaluate the frame OUTREF at the epoch
                                associated its center. This epoch,
                                which we'll call ETCTR, is determined
                                as follows:

                                   Let LTCTR be the one-way light time
                                   between the observer and the center 
                                   of OUTREF. Then ETCTR is

                                      ET-LTCTR  if reception
                                                aberration corrections
                                                are used

                                      ET+LTCTR  if transmission
                                                aberration corrections
                                                are used

                                      ET        if no aberration
                                                corrections are used


                                The locus 'CENTER' should be selected
                                when the user intends to obtain
                                results compatible with those produced
                                by <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a>. 
 
                 When OUTREF is inertial, all choices of REFLOC 
                 yield the same results.
     
                 Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
                 significant in the string REFLOC.


     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
                 the observer-target state to account for one-way
                 light time and stellar aberration.
                  
                 ABCORR may be any of the following:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the 
                               geometric state of the target 
                               relative to the observer.  

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                               called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                               Newtonian formulation. This correction
                               yields the state of the target at the
                               moment it emitted photons arriving at
                               the observer at ET.

                               The light time correction uses an
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation. The solution invoked by the
                               'LT' option uses one iteration.

                    'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                               stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This option modifies the
                               state obtained with the 'LT' option to
                               account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The result is the apparent
                               state of the target---the position and
                               velocity of the target as seen by the
                               observer.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                               and stellar aberration corrections.


                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
                 the observer's location at ET and arrive at the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET+LT:

                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This correction yields the
                               state of the target at the moment it
                               receives photons emitted from the
                               observer's location at ET.

                    'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time and stellar
                               aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation  This option modifies the
                               state obtained with the 'XLT' option to
                               account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The position component of
                               the computed target state indicates the
                               direction that photons emitted from the
                               observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to
                               hit the target.

                    'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged 
                               Newtonian light time correction.

                    'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged 
                               Newtonian light time and stellar 
                               aberration corrections.


                 Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
                 accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
                 by this routine.

                 Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
                 significant in the string ABCORR.


     OBSRVR      is the name of an observing body. Optionally, you
                 may supply the ID code of the object as an integer
                 string. For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are
                 legitimate strings to supply to indicate the
                 observer is Earth.

                 Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
                 significant in the string OBSRVR.

                 components of STATE represent the x-, y- and
                 z-components of the target's position; the last three
                 components form the corresponding velocity vector.

                 The position component of STATE points from the
                 observer's location at ET to the aberration-corrected
                 location of the target. Note that the sense of the
                 position vector is independent of the direction of
                 radiation travel implied by the aberration
                 correction.

                 The velocity component of STATE is the derivative
                 with respect to time of the position component of
                 STATE.

                 Units are always km and km/sec.

                 When STATE is expressed in a time-dependent
                 (non-inertial) output frame, the orientation of that
                 frame relative to the J2000 frame is evaluated in the
                 manner indicated by the input argument REFLOC (see
                 description above).


     LT          is the one-way light time between the observer and
                 target in seconds. If the target state is corrected 
                 for aberrations, then LT is the one-way light time 
                 between the observer and the light time corrected 
                 target location.

     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
     this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        -  SPK data: ephemeris data for target center and observer
           must be loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the
           states of target center and observer relative to the solar
           system barycenter must be calculable from the available
           ephemeris data. Typically ephemeris data are made available
           by loading one or more SPK files using <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

     The following data may be required:

        -  PCK data: if the target frame is a PCK frame, rotation data
           for the target frame must be loaded. These may be provided
           in a text or binary PCK file.

        -  Frame data: if a frame definition not built into SPICE is
           required, for example to convert the observer-target state
           to the output frame, that definition must be available in
           the kernel pool. Typically frame definitions are supplied
           by loading a frame kernel using <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        -  Additional kernels: if any frame used in this routine's
           state computation is a CK frame, then at least one CK and
           corresponding SCLK kernel is required. If dynamic frames
           are used, additional SPK, PCK, CK, or SCLK kernels may be
           required.

     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
     run, NOT every time this routine is called.

     This routine computes observer-target states for targets whose
     trajectories are not provided by SPK files.

     Targets supported by this routine must have constant position
     with respect to a specified center of motion, expressed in a
     caller-specified reference frame. The state of the center of
     motion relative to the observer must be computable using 
     loaded SPK data.

     For applications in which the target has non-zero, constant
     velocity relative to its center of motion, the SPICELIB routine

        <a href="spkcvt.html">SPKCVT</a>     { SPK, constant velocity target }

     can be used.
     
     This routine is suitable for computing states of landmarks on the
     surface of an extended object, as seen by a specified observer,
     in cases where no SPK data are available for those landmarks.

     This routine's treatment of the output reference frame differs
     from that of the principal SPK API routines

        <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a>
        <a href="spkez.html">SPKEZ</a>
        <a href="spkpos.html">SPKPOS</a>
        <a href="spkezp.html">SPKEZP</a>

     which require both observer and target ephemerides to be provided
     by loaded SPK files:

        The SPK API routines listed above evaluate the orientation of
        the output reference frame (with respect to the J2000 frame)
        at an epoch corrected for one-way light time between the
        observer and the center of the output frame. When the center
        of the output frame is not the target (for example, when the
        target is on the surface of Mars and the output frame is
        centered at Mars' center), the epoch of evaluation may not
        closely match the light-time corrected epoch associated with
        the target itself.
 
        This routine allows the caller to dictate how the orientation
        of the output reference frame is to be evaluated. The caller
        passes to this routine an input string called the output
        frame's evaluation &quot;locus.&quot; This string specifies the location
        associated with the output frame's evaluation epoch. The three
        possible values of the locus are

           'TARGET'
           'OBSERVER'
           'CENTER'        

        The choice of locus has an effect when aberration corrections
        are used and the output frame is non-inertial.

        When the locus is 'TARGET' and light time corrections are
        used, the orientation of the output frame is evaluated at the
        epoch obtained by correcting the observation epoch ET for
        one-way light time LT. The evaluation epoch will be either
        ET-LT or ET+LT for reception or transmission corrections
        respectively.

        For remote sensing applications where the target is a surface
        point on an extended object, and the orientation of that
        object should be evaluated at the emission time, the locus
        'TARGET' should be used.

        When the output frame's orientation should be evaluated at
        the observation epoch ET, which is the case when the 
        output frame is centered at the observer, the locus 
        'OBSERVER' should be used.
        
        The locus option 'CENTER' is provided for compatibility
        with existing SPK state computation APIs such as <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a>.

        Note that the output frame evaluation locus does not affect
        the computation of light time between the target and
        observer. 


     The SPK routines that compute observer-target states for
     combinations of objects having ephemerides provided by the SPK
     system and objects having constant position or constant velocity
     are

        <a href="spkcpo.html">SPKCPO</a> {SPK, Constant position observer}

     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine 
     specific arithmetic implementation. 

     1) Demonstrate use of this routine; in particular demonstrate
        applications of the output frame evaluation locus. 
     
        The following program is not necessarily realistic: for
        brevity, it combines several unrelated computations.

        Task Description
        ================

        Find the state of a given surface point on earth, corrected
        for light time and stellar aberration, relative to the Mars
        Global Surveyor spacecraft, expressed in the earth fixed
        reference frame ITRF93. The selected point is the position
        of the DSN station DSS-14.

        Contrast the states computed by setting the output frame
        evaluation locus to 'TARGET' and to 'CENTER'. Show that the
        latter choice produces results very close to those that
        can be obtained using <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a>.

        Also compute the state of a selected Mars surface point as
        seen from MGS. The point we'll use is the narrow angle MOC
        boresight surface intercept corresponding to the chosen
        observation time. Express the state in a spacecraft-centered
        reference frame. Use the output frame evaluation locus
        'OBSERVER' for this computation.
 
        The observation epoch is 2003 OCT 13 06:00:00 UTC.
