<h4><a name="Detailed_Input">Detailed_Input</a></h4>
<PRE>
     TARG        is the NAIF ID code for a target body. The target
                 and observer define a state vector whose position
                 component points from the observer to the target.

     ET          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past J2000
                 TDB, at which the state of the target body relative to
                 the observer is to be computed. ET refers to time at
                 the observer's location.

     REF         is the name of the reference frame relative to which
                 the output state vector should be expressed. This may
                 be any frame supported by the SPICE system, including
                 built-in frames (documented in the Frames Required
                 Reading) and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel
                 (FK).

                 When REF designates a non-inertial frame, the
                 orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch 
                 dependent on the selected aberration correction.
                 See the description of the output state vector STARG
                 for details.

     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                 to the state of the target body to account for one-way
                 light time and stellar aberration. See the discussion
                 in the Particulars section for recommendations on 
                 how to choose aberration corrections.
                  
                 ABCORR may be any of the following:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the 
                               geometric state of the target body 
                               relative to the observer.  

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                               called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                               Newtonian formulation. This correction
                               yields the state of the target at the
                               moment it emitted photons arriving at
                               the observer at ET.

                               The light time correction uses an
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation (see Particulars for details).
                               The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                               uses one iteration.

                    'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                               stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This option modifies the
                               state obtained with the 'LT' option to
                               account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The result is the apparent
                               state of the target---the position and
                               velocity of the target as seen by the
                               observer.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges (three
                               iterations on all supported platforms).
                               Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                               substantially more accurate than the
                               'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                               of the participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed. See the Particulars section
                               below for a discussion of precision of
                               light time corrections.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction and stellar aberration
                               correction.


                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
                 the observer's location at ET and arrive at the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET+LT:

                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This correction yields the
                               state of the target at the moment it
                               receives photons emitted from the
                               observer's location at ET.

                    'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time and stellar
                               aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation  This option modifies the
                               state obtained with the 'XLT' option to
                               account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The position component of
                               the computed target state indicates the
                               direction that photons emitted from the
                               observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to
                               hit the target.

                    'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged 
                               Newtonian light time correction.

                    'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                               Newtonian light time correction and
                               stellar aberration correction.


                 Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
                 accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
                 by this routine.

                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string
                 ABCORR.

     OBS         is the NAIF ID code for an observing body.

     STARG       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position
                 and velocity of the target body relative to the
                 specified observer. STARG is corrected for the
                 specified aberrations, and is expressed with respect
                 to the reference frame specified by REF. The first
                 three components of STARG represent the x-, y- and
                 z-components of the target's position; the last three
                 components form the corresponding velocity vector.

                 The position component of STARG points from the
                 observer's location at ET to the aberration-corrected
                 location of the target. Note that the sense of the
                 position vector is independent of the direction of
                 radiation travel implied by the aberration
                 correction.

                 The velocity component of STARG is the derivative
                 with respect to time of the position component of
                 STARG.

                 Units are always km and km/sec.

                 Non-inertial frames are treated as follows: letting
                 LTCENT be the one-way light time between the observer
                 and the central body associated with the frame, the
                 orientation of the frame is evaluated at ET-LTCENT,
                 ET+LTCENT, or ET depending on whether the requested
                 aberration correction is, respectively, for received
                 radiation, transmitted radiation, or is omitted.
                 LTCENT is computed using the method indicated by
                 ABCORR.

     LT          is the one-way light time between the observer and
                 target in seconds. If the target state is corrected
                 for aberrations, then LT is the one-way light time 
                 between the observer and the light time corrected 
                 target location.

     Aberration corrections
     ======================

     In space science or engineering applications one frequently
     wishes to know where to point a remote sensing instrument, such
     as an optical camera or radio antenna, in order to observe or
     otherwise receive radiation from a target. This pointing problem
     is complicated by the finite speed of light:  one needs to point
     to where the target appears to be as opposed to where it actually
     is at the epoch of observation. We use the adjectives
     &quot;geometric,&quot; &quot;uncorrected,&quot; or &quot;true&quot; to refer to an actual
     position or state of a target at a specified epoch. When a
     geometric position or state vector is modified to reflect how it
     appears to an observer, we describe that vector by any of the
     terms &quot;apparent,&quot; &quot;corrected,&quot; &quot;aberration corrected,&quot; or &quot;light
     time and stellar aberration corrected.&quot; The SPICE Toolkit can
     correct for two phenomena affecting the apparent location of an
     object:  one-way light time (also called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;)
     and stellar aberration.

     One-way light time
     ------------------

     Correcting for one-way light time is done by computing, given an
     observer and observation epoch, where a target was when the
     observed photons departed the target's location. The vector from
     the observer to this computed target location is called a &quot;light
     time corrected&quot; vector. The light time correction depends on the
     motion of the target relative to the solar system barycenter, but
     it is independent of the velocity of the observer relative to the
     solar system barycenter. Relativistic effects such as light
     bending and gravitational delay are not accounted for in the
     light time correction performed by this routine.

     Stellar aberration
     ------------------

     The velocity of the observer also affects the apparent location
     of a target:  photons arriving at the observer are subject to a
     &quot;raindrop effect&quot; whereby their velocity relative to the observer
     is, using a Newtonian approximation, the photons' velocity
     relative to the solar system barycenter minus the velocity of the
     observer relative to the solar system barycenter. This effect is
     called &quot;stellar aberration.&quot;  Stellar aberration is independent
     of the velocity of the target. The stellar aberration formula
     used by this routine does not include (the much smaller) 
     relativistic effects.

     Stellar aberration corrections are applied after light time
     corrections:  the light time corrected target position vector is 
     used as an input to the stellar aberration correction.

     When light time and stellar aberration corrections are both
     applied to a geometric position vector, the resulting position 
     vector indicates where the target &quot;appears to be&quot; from the
     observer's location. 

     As opposed to computing the apparent position of a target, one
     may wish to compute the pointing direction required for
     transmission of photons to the target. This also requires
     correction of the geometric target position for the effects of
     light time and stellar aberration, but in this case the
     corrections are computed for radiation traveling *from* the
     observer to the target.

     The &quot;transmission&quot; light time correction yields the target's
     location as it will be when photons emitted from the observer's
     location at ET arrive at the target. The transmission stellar
     aberration correction is the inverse of the traditional stellar
     aberration correction:  it indicates the direction in which
     radiation should be emitted so that, using a Newtonian
     approximation, the sum of the velocity of the radiation relative
     to the observer and of the observer's velocity, relative to the 
     solar system barycenter, yields a velocity vector that points in 
     the direction of the light time corrected position of the target.
   
     One may object to using the term &quot;observer&quot; in the transmission
     case, in which radiation is emitted from the observer's location.
     The terminology was retained for consistency with earlier
     documentation.

     Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some
     common applications:


        1) Find the apparent direction of a target for a remote-sensing
           observation.

              Use 'LT+S' or 'CN+S: apply both light time and stellar 
              aberration corrections.

           Note that using light time corrections alone ('LT' or 'CN')
           is generally not a good way to obtain an approximation to
           an apparent target vector: since light time and stellar
           aberration corrections often partially cancel each other,
           it may be more accurate to use no correction at all than to
           use light time alone.


        2) Find the corrected pointing direction to radiate a signal
           to a target. This computation is often applicable for 
           implementing communications sessions.

              Use 'XLT+S' or 'XCN+S: apply both light time and stellar 
              aberration corrections for transmission.


        3) Compute the apparent position of a target body relative
           to a star or other distant object.

              Use 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', or 'CN+S' as needed to match the
              correction applied to the position of the distant
              object. For example, if a star position is obtained from
              a catalog, the position vector may not be corrected for
              stellar aberration. In this case, to find the angular
              separation of the star and the limb of a planet, the
              vector from the observer to the planet should be
              corrected for light time but not stellar aberration.


        4) Obtain an uncorrected state vector derived directly from 
           data in an SPK file.

              Use 'NONE'.


        5) Use a geometric state vector as a low-accuracy estimate
           of the apparent state for an application where execution 
           speed is critical.

              Use 'NONE'.


        6) While this routine cannot perform the relativistic
           aberration corrections required to compute states
           with the highest possible accuracy, it can supply the
           geometric states required as inputs to these computations.

              Use 'NONE', then apply relativistic aberration
              corrections (not available in the SPICE Toolkit).


     Below, we discuss in more detail how the aberration corrections
     applied by this routine are computed.     

        Geometric case
        ==============

        <b>SPKEZ</b> begins by computing the geometric position T(ET) of the
        target body relative to the solar system barycenter (SSB).
        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(ET) gives
        the geometric position of the target body relative to the
        observer. The one-way light time, LT, is given by

                  | T(ET) - O(ET) |
           LT = -------------------
                          c

        The geometric relationship between the observer, target, and
        solar system barycenter is as shown:


           SSB ---&gt; O(ET)
            |      /
            |     /
            |    /                           
            |   /  T(ET) - O(ET)  
            V  V                                  
           T(ET)


        The returned state consists of the position vector

           T(ET) - O(ET)

        and a velocity obtained by taking the difference of the
        corresponding velocities. In the geometric case, the 
        returned velocity is actually the time derivative of the 
        position.


        Reception case
        ==============

        When any of the options 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', 'CN+S' is selected
        for ABCORR, <b>SPKEZ</b> computes the position of the target body at
        epoch ET-LT, where LT is the one-way light time. Let T(t) and
        O(t) represent the positions of the target and observer
        relative to the solar system barycenter at time t; then LT is
        the solution of the light-time equation

                  | T(ET-LT) - O(ET) |
           LT = ------------------------                            (1)
                           c

        The ratio 

            | T(ET) - O(ET) |
          ---------------------                                     (2)
                    c

        is used as a first approximation to LT; inserting (2) into the
        right hand side of the light-time equation (1) yields the
        &quot;one-iteration&quot; estimate of the one-way light time (&quot;LT&quot;).
        Repeating the process until the estimates of LT converge
        yields the &quot;converged Newtonian&quot; light time estimate (&quot;CN&quot;).

        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(ET) gives
        the position of the target body relative to the observer:
        T(ET-LT) - O(ET).

           SSB ---&gt; O(ET)
            | \     |
            |  \    |
            |   \   | T(ET-LT) - O(ET)
            |    \  |
            V     V V
           T(ET)  T(ET-LT)
        
        The position component of the light time corrected state 
        is the vector

           T(ET-LT) - O(ET)

        The velocity component of the light time corrected state 
        is the difference

           T_vel(ET-LT)*(1-dLT/dET) - O_vel(ET)
            
        where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of the
        target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter at
        the epochs ET-LT and ET. 

        If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
        position is rotated toward the solar system barycenter-
        relative velocity vector of the observer. The rotation is
        computed as follows:

           Let r be the light time corrected vector from the observer
           to the object, and v be the velocity of the observer with
           respect to the solar system barycenter. Let w be the angle
           between them. The aberration angle phi is given by

              sin(phi) = v sin(w) / c

           Let h be the vector given by the cross product

              h = r X v

           Rotate r by phi radians about h to obtain the apparent
           position of the object.

        When stellar aberration corrections are used, the rate of
        change of the stellar aberration correction is accounted for
        in the computation of the output velocity.


        Transmission case
        ==================

        When any of the options 'XLT', 'XCN', 'XLT+S', 'XCN+S' is
        selected, <b>SPKEZ</b> computes the position of the target body T at
        epoch ET+LT, where LT is the one-way light time. LT is the
        solution of the light-time equation

                  | T(ET+LT) - O(ET) |
           LT = ------------------------                            (3)
                            c

        Subtracting the geometric position of the observer, O(ET),
        gives the position of the target body relative to the
        observer: T(ET-LT) - O(ET).

                   SSB --&gt; O(ET)
                  / |    * 
                 /  |  *  T(ET+LT) - O(ET)  
                /   |*     
               /   *|    
              V  V  V     
          T(ET+LT)  T(ET)    

        The position component of the light-time corrected state 
        is the vector

           T(ET+LT) - O(ET)

        The velocity component of the light-time corrected state 
        consists of the difference

           T_vel(ET+LT)*(1+dLT/dET) - O_vel(ET)
            
        where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of the
        target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter at
        the epochs ET+LT and ET.

        If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
        position is rotated away from the solar system barycenter-
        relative velocity vector of the observer. The rotation is
        computed as in the reception case, but the sign of the
        rotation angle is negated. Velocities are adjusted to account
        for the rate of change of the stellar aberration correction.


     Precision of light time corrections
     ===================================

        Corrections using one iteration of the light time solution
        ----------------------------------------------------------

        When the requested aberration correction is 'LT', 'LT+S',
        'XLT', or 'XLT+S', only one iteration is performed in the
        algorithm used to compute LT.

        The relative error in this computation

           | LT_ACTUAL - LT_COMPUTED |  /  LT_ACTUAL

        is at most 

            (V/C)**2
           ----------
            1 - (V/C)

        which is well approximated by (V/C)**2, where V is the
        velocity of the target relative to an inertial frame and C is
        the speed of light.

        For nearly all objects in the solar system V is less than 60
        km/sec. The value of C is ~300000 km/sec. Thus the
        one-iteration solution for LT has a potential relative error
        of not more than 4e-8. This is a potential light time error of
        approximately 2e-5 seconds per astronomical unit of distance
        separating the observer and target. Given the bound on V cited
        above:

           As long as the observer and target are separated by less
           than 50 astronomical units, the error in the light time
           returned using the one-iteration light time corrections is
           less than 1 millisecond.

           The magnitude of the corresponding position error, given
           the above assumptions, may be as large as (V/C)**2 * the
           distance between the observer and the uncorrected target
           position: 300 km or equivalently 6 km/AU.

        In practice, the difference between positions obtained using
        one-iteration and converged light time is usually much smaller
        than the value computed above and can be insignificant. For
        example, for the spacecraft Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and
        Mars Express, the position error for the one-iteration light
        time correction, applied to the spacecraft-to-Mars center
        vector, is at the 1 cm level.
        
        Comparison of results obtained using the one-iteration and
        converged light time solutions is recommended when adequacy of
        the one-iteration solution is in doubt.


        Converged corrections 
        ---------------------

        When the requested aberration correction is 'CN', 'CN+S',
        'XCN', or 'XCN+S', as many iterations as are required for
        convergence are performed in the computation of LT. Usually
        the solution is found after three iterations. The relative
        error present in this case is at most

            (V/C)**4
           ----------
            1 - (V/C)

        which is well approximated by (V/C)**4. 

           The precision of this computation (ignoring round-off
           error) is better than 4e-11 seconds for any pair of objects
           less than 50 AU apart, and having speed relative to the
           solar system barycenter less than 60 km/s.

           The magnitude of the corresponding position error, given
           the above assumptions, may be as large as (V/C)**4 * the
           distance between the observer and the uncorrected target
           position: 1.2 cm at 50 AU or equivalently 0.24 mm/AU.

        However, to very accurately model the light time between
        target and observer one must take into account effects due to
        general relativity. These may be as high as a few hundredths
        of a millisecond for some objects. 


     Relativistic Corrections
     =========================

     This routine does not attempt to perform either general or
     special relativistic corrections in computing the various
     aberration corrections. For many applications relativistic
     corrections are not worth the expense of added computation
     cycles. If however, your application requires these additional
     corrections we suggest you consult the astronomical almanac (page
     B36) for a discussion of how to carry out these corrections.

        Discussion of light time corrections was updated. Assertions
        that converged light time corrections are unlikely to be
        useful were removed.

    Last update was 23-SEP-2013 (NJB) (BVS)

        Bug fix: replaced calls to ZZPRSCOR with calls to
        ZZVALCOR. The latter routine rejects all aberration
        corrections not supported by the SPK subsystem.

        Bug fix: added a check and an exception for the FOUND flag
        returned by <a href="frinfo.html">FRINFO</a>.

        Updated to save the input frame name and <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> state counter
        and to do frame name-ID conversion only if the counter has
        changed.

        Updated various in-line comments.

    SPICELIB Version 5.0.1, 18-MAY-2010 (BVS)

        Removed &quot;C$&quot; marker from text in the header.

    SPICELIB Version 5.0.0, 27-DEC-2007 (NJB)

        This routine was upgraded to more accurately compute
        aberration-corrected velocity, and in particular, make it
        more consistent with observer-target positions. 

        When light time corrections are used, the derivative of light
        time with respect to time is now accounted for in the
        computation of observer-target velocities. When the reference
        frame associated with the output state is time-dependent, the
        derivative of light time with respect to time is now accounted
        for in the computation of the rate of change of orientation of
        the reference frame.

        When stellar aberration corrections are used, velocities
        now reflect the rate of range of the stellar aberration
        correction.
              
    SPICELIB Version 4.1.0, 05-JAN-2005 (NJB)

        Tests of routine <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a>() were added.
        Minor header error was corrected.

    SPICELIB Version 4.0.2, 20-OCT-2003 (EDW)

        Added mention that LT returns in seconds.

    SPICELIB Version 4.0.1, 29-JUL-2003 (NJB) (CHA)

        Various minor header changes were made to improve clarity.

    SPICELIB Version 4.0.0, 28-DEC-2001 (NJB)

        Updated to handle aberration corrections for transmission
        of radiation. Formerly, only the reception case was 
        supported. The header was revised and expanded to explain 
        the functionality of this routine in more detail.

    SPICELIB Version 3.1.0, 09-JUL-1996 (WLT)

        Corrected the description of LT in the Detailed Output 
        section of the header.

    SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 26-MAY-1995 (WLT)

        The routine was upgraded to support non-inertial frames.

    SPICELIB Version 2.1.1, 5-AUG-1994 (HAN) (MJS)

        Added code so that routine accepts lower case, mixed case
        and upper case versions of the string ABCORR.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.1, 10-MAR-1992 (WLT)

        Comment section for permuted index source lines was added
        following the header.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 18-JUL-1991 (JEM) (NJB)

        The old <b>SPKEZ</b> did not compute the geometric state of one body
        with respect to another unless data existed for each body with
        respect to the solar system barycenter.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.1, 22-MAR-1990 (HAN)

        Literature references added to the header.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.0, 31-JAN-1990 (IMU)</PRE>
