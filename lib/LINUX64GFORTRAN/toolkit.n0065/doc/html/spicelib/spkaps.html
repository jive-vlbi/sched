     TARG        is the NAIF ID code for a target body.  The target
                 and observer define a state vector whose position
                 component points from the observer to the target.

     ET          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past
                 J2000 TDB, at which the state of the target body
                 relative to the observer is to be computed.  ET
                 refers to time at the observer's location.

     REF         is the inertial reference frame with respect to which
                 the input state STOBS, the input acceleration ACCOBS,
                 and the output state STARG are expressed. REF must be
                 recognized by the SPICE Toolkit.  The acceptable
                 frames are listed in the Frames Required Reading, as
                 well as in the SPICELIB routine <a href="chgirf.html">CHGIRF</a>.

                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string
                 REF.
 
     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                 to the state of the target body to account for one-way
                 light time and stellar aberration. See the discussion
                 in the header of <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for recommendations on 
                 how to choose aberration corrections.
                  
                 ABCORR may be any of the following:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the 
                               geometric state of the target body 
                               relative to the observer.  

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                               called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                               Newtonian formulation. This correction
                               yields the state of the target at the
                               moment it emitted photons arriving at
                               the observer at ET.

                               The light time correction uses an
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation (see Particulars for details).
                               The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                               uses one iteration.

                    'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                               stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This option modifies the
                               state obtained with the 'LT' option to
                               account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The result is the apparent
                               state of the target---the position and
                               velocity of the target as seen by the
                               observer.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges (three
                               iterations on all supported platforms).
                               Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                               substantially more accurate than the
                               'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                               of the participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed. See the Particulars section of
                               <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a discussion of precision of
                               light time corrections.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction and stellar aberration
                               correction.

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
                 the observer's location at ET and arrive at the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET+LT:

                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This correction yields the
                               state of the target at the moment it
                               receives photons emitted from the
                               observer's location at ET.

                    'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time and stellar
                               aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation  This option modifies the
                               state obtained with the 'XLT' option to
                               account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The position component of
                               the computed target state indicates the
                               direction that photons emitted from the
                               observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to
                               hit the target.

                    'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged 
                               Newtonian light time correction.

                    'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                               Newtonian light time correction and
                               stellar aberration correction.


                 Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
                 accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
                 by this routine.

                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string
                 ABCORR.

                                 
     STOBS       is the geometric state of the observer relative to
                 the solar system barycenter at ET. STOBS is expressed
                 relative to the reference frame designated by REF.
                 The target and observer define a state vector whose
                 position component points from the observer to the
                 target.

     ACCOBS      is the geometric acceleration of the observer
                 relative to the solar system barycenter at ET. This
                 is the derivative with respect to time of the
                 velocity portion of STOBS. ACCOBS is expressed
                 relative to the reference frame designated by REF.

                 ACCOBS is used for computing stellar aberration
                 corrected velocity. If stellar aberration corrections
                 are not specified by ABCORR, ACCOBS is ignored; the
                 caller need not provide a valid input value in this
                 case.

<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     STARG       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position
                 and velocity of the target body relative to the
                 specified observer. STARG is corrected for the
                 specified aberrations, and is expressed with respect
                 to the inertial reference frame designated by REF.
                 The first three components of STARG represent the x-,
                 y- and z-components of the target's position; last
                 three components form the corresponding velocity
                 vector.

                 The position component of STARG points from the
                 observer's location at ET to the aberration-corrected
                 location of the target. Note that the sense of the
                 position vector is independent of the direction of
                 radiation travel implied by the aberration
                 correction.

                 Units are always km and km/sec.

     LT          is the one-way light time between the observer and
                 target in seconds.  If the target state is corrected
                 for light time, then LT is the one-way light time 
                 between the observer and the light time-corrected 
                 target location.

     DLT         is the derivative with respect to barycentric
                 dynamical time of the one way light time between
                 target and observer:

                    DLT = d(LT)/d(ET)

                 DLT can also be described as the rate of change of 
                 one way light time. DLT is unitless, since LT and
                 ET both have units of TDB seconds.

                 If the observer and target are at the same position,
                 then DLT is set to zero.

     This routine computes states using SPK files that have been
     loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading
     interface routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.  Application programs typically load
     kernels once before this routine is called, for example during
     program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly.
     See the routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading
     for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels.

     If any of the ephemeris data used to compute STARG are expressed
     relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those
     data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference
     frame transformations required to compute the state. Normally
     these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels. Any such
     kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is
     called.

     User applications normally will not need to call this routine
     directly. However, this routine can improve run-time efficiency
     in situations where many targets are observed from the same
     location at the same time. In such cases, the state and
     acceleration of the observer relative to the solar system
     barycenter need be computed only once per look-up epoch.

     When apparent positions, rather than apparent states, are
     required, consider using the high-level position-only API
     routines

        <a href="spkpos.html">SPKPOS</a>
        <a href="spkezp.html">SPKEZP</a>

     or the low-level, position-only analog of this routine

        <a href="spkapo.html">SPKAPO</a>

     In general, the position-only routines are more efficient.

     See the header of the routine <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a detailed discussion
     of aberration corrections.

    1) Look up a sequence of states of the Moon as seen from the
       Earth. Use light time and stellar aberration corrections.
       Compute the first state for the epoch 2000 JAN 1 12:00:00 TDB;
       compute subsequent states at intervals of 1 hour. For each
       epoch, display the states, the one way light time between
       target and observer, and the rate of change of the one way
       light time.

       Use the following meta-kernel to specify the kernels to 
       load:

          KPL/MK

          This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
          example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
          assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
          required by SPICE-based user applications.

          In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
          kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
          current working directory.

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>
<PRE>
     1) This routine should not be used to compute geometric states.
        Instead, use <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a>, <a href="spkez.html">SPKEZ</a>, or <a href="spkgeo.html">SPKGEO</a>. <a href="spkgeo.html">SPKGEO</a>, which is called
        by <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> and <a href="spkez.html">SPKEZ</a>, introduces less round-off error when the
        observer and target have a common center that is closer to
        both objects than is the solar system barycenter.

     2) The kernel files to be used by <b>SPKAPS</b> must be loaded
        (normally by the SPICELIB kernel loader <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>) before 
        this routine is called.

     3) Unlike most other SPK state computation routines, this
        routine requires that the output state be relative to an
        inertial reference frame.
