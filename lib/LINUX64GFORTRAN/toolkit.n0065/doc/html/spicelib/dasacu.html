<h4><a name="Detailed_Input">Detailed_Input</a></h4>
<PRE>
     COMLUN   The Fortran logical unit of a previously opened text
              file which contains comments that are to be added to
              the comment area of a binary E-Kernel file.

     BEGMRK   A marker which identifies the beginning of the comments
              in the comment text file. This marker must appear on a
              line by itself, and leading and trailing blanks are not
              significant.

              The line immediately following this marker is the first
              comment line to be placed into the comment area of the
              binary DAS file.

              If the begin marker is blank, BEGMRK .EQ. ' ', then the
              comments are assumed to start at the current location
              in the comment text file.

     ENDMRK   A marker which identifies the end of the comments in the
              comment text file. This marker must appear on a line by
              itself, and leading and trailing blanks are not
              significant.

              The line immediately preceeding this marker is the last
              comment line to be placed into the comment area of the
              binary DAS file.

              If the end marker is blank, ENDMRK .EQ. ' ', then the
              comments are assumed to stop at the end of the comment
              text file.

     INSBLN   A logical flag which indicates whether a blank line is
              to be inserted into the comment area of the binary DAS
              file attached to HANDLE before any comments are added
              to the comment area of the DAS file. This is to provide
              a simple mechanism for separating any comments already
              contained in the comment area of a DAS file from those
              comments that are being added.

              If the comment area of a binary DAS file is empty, the
              value of this flag is not significant, the comments will
              simply be placed into the comment area.

     HANDLE   The file handle for a binary DAS file that has been
              opened with write access.

     1)   If the scratch file for temporarily holding the comments

     2)   If a non printing ASCII character is encountered in the
          comments, the error SPICE(ILLEGALCHARACTER) will be
          signalled.

     3)   If the begin marker cannot be found in the text file, the
          error SPICE(MARKERNOTFOUND) will be signalled.

     4)   If the end marker cannot be found in the text file, the
          error SPICE(MARKERNOTFOUND) will be signalled.

          culled from the comment text file. This is so we do not

          comments in the original file.

     This routine will place all lines between two specified markers,
     a `begin comments marker' and an `end comments marker,' in a
     text file into the comment area of a binary DAS file attached to
     HANDLE. If the `begin comments marker' is blank, then the
     comments are asumed to start at the current location of the
     comment text file attached to COMLUN. If the `end comments
     marker' is blank, then the comments are assumed to stop at the
     end of the comment text file attached to COMLUN.

     We will be using the files `jabber.txt', 'batty.txt', and
     `wndrland.das' in the example which follows.

     `wndrland.das' is a binary DAS file with an empty comment area
                    into which we are going to place the entire file
                    `jabber.txt' and a selected portion of the file
                    `batty.txt'.

     `jabber.txt'   is a text file that is to be placed into the
                    comment area of the binary DAS file `wndrland.das'.

     `batty.txt'    is a text file from which will have a selected
                    portion of its text placed into the comment area
                    of the binary DAS file `wndrland.das'.

     Let -BOF- and -EOF- denote the beginning and end of a file,
     respectively.

     The file `jabber.txt' contains:

        -BOF-
                  The Jabberwock

        'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
              Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
        All mimsy were the borogoves,
              And the mome raths outgrabe.

        ``Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
              The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!''

        And as in uffish thought he stood,
              The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
        Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
              And burbled as it came!

        One, two! One, two! And through and through
              The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
        He left it dead, and with its head
              He went galumphing back.

        ``And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
              Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
        O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!''
              He chortled in his joy.

               Through the Looking-Glass
               Lewis Carroll
        -EOF-

     The file `batty.txt' contains:

        -BOF-
        This file contains a brief poem about bats.

        BEGIN bat poem
        Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
        How I wonder what you're at!
        Up above the world you fly!
        Like a teatray in the sky.

               Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
               Lewis Carroll
        END bat poem

        And that's that for bats.
        -EOF-

     Let

           JABLUN   be the logical unit for the file `jabber.txt'
           BATLUN   be the logical unit for the file `batty.txt'
     and
           HANDLE   be the DAS handle for the file `wndrland.das'

            CALL TXTOPN ( `batty.txt'   , BATLUN )
     C
     C      Initialize the markers for the file `jabber.txt'. We want

     C
     C      Initialize the markers for the file `batty.txt'. We want
     C      to include the bat poem only, so we define the begin and

     C
            BEGMRK = 'BEGIN bat poem'
            ENDMRK = 'END bat poem'

     C
     C      Close the files.

            CLOSE       ( BATLUN )
            CALL <a href="dascls.html">DASCLS</a> ( HANDLE )

     1) The begin comments marker, BEGMRK, and the end comments marker,
        ENDMRK, must each appear alone on a line in the comment text
        file if they are not blank.

     2) The maximum length of a text line in a comment file is
        specified by the LINLEN parameter defined below. Currently
        this values is 255 characters.

     3) The maximum length of a single line comment in the comment
        area is specified by the parameter LINLEN defined below.
        Currently this value is 255 characters.

     4) This routine uses constants that are specific to the ASCII
        character sequence. The results of using this routine with
        a different character sequence are unpredictable.
