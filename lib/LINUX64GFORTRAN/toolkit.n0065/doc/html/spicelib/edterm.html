     TRMTYP      is a string indicating the type of terminator to
                 compute: umbral or penumbral. The umbral terminator
                 is the boundary of the portion of the ellipsoid
                 surface in total shadow. The penumbral terminator is
                 the boundary of the portion of the surface that is
                 completely illuminated. Note that in astronomy
                 references, the unqualified word &quot;terminator&quot; refers
                 to the umbral terminator. Here, the unqualified 
                 word refers to either type of terminator.

                 Possible values of TRMTYP are

                    'UMBRAL' 
                    'PENUMBRAL'

                 Case and leading or trailing blanks in TRMTYP are
                 not significant.


     SOURCE      is the name of the body acting as a light source.
                 SOURCE is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
                 blanks in TARGET are not significant. Optionally, you
                 may supply a string containing the integer ID code
                 for the object. For example both 'SUN' and '10' are
                 legitimate strings that indicate the Sun is the light
                 source.

                 This routine assumes that a kernel variable
                 representing the light source's radii is present in
                 the kernel pool. Normally the kernel variable would
                 be defined by loading a PCK file.

                 The shape of the light source is always modeled as a
                 sphere, regardless of whether radii defining a
                 triaxial ellipsoidal shape model are available in the
                 kernel pool. The maximum radius of the body is used
                 as the radius of the sphere.


     TARGET      is the name of the target body. TARGET is
                 case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
                 TARGET are not significant. Optionally, you may
                 supply a string containing the integer ID code for
                 the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
                 legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
                 target body.

                 This routine assumes that a kernel variable
                 representing the target's radii is present in the
                 kernel pool. Normally the kernel variable would be
                 defined by loading a PCK file.


     ET          is the epoch of participation of the observer,
                 expressed as ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB: ET is
                 the epoch at which the observer's position is
                 computed.

                 When aberration corrections are not used, ET is also
                 the epoch at which the position and orientation of the
                 target body and position of the light source are
                 computed.

                 When aberration corrections are used, ET is the epoch
                 at which the observer's position relative to the
                 solar system barycenter is computed; in this case the
                 position and orientation of the target body are
                 computed at ET-LT, where LT is the one-way light time
                 between the target body's center and the observer.
                 See the description of ABCORR below for details.


     FIXREF      is the name of the reference frame relative to which
                 the output terminator points are expressed. This must
                 be a body-centered, body-fixed frame associated with
                 the target. The frame's axes must be compatible with
                 the triaxial ellipsoidal shape model associated with
                 the target body (normally provide via a PCK): this
                 routine assumes that the first, second, and third
                 axis lengths correspond, respectively, to the x, y,
                 and z-axes of the frame designated by FIXREF.

                 FIXREF may refer to a built-in frame (documented in
                 the Frames Required Reading) or a frame defined by a
                 loaded frame kernel (FK).

                 The orientation of the frame designated by FIXREF is
                 evaluated at epoch of participation of the target
                 body. See the descriptions of ET and ABCORR for
                 details.


     ABCORR      indicates the aberration correction to be applied
                 when computing the observer-target position, the
                 orientation of the target body, and the target-
                 source position vector. ABCORR may be any of
                 the following.

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Compute the 
                               terminator points using the position
                               of the light source and target, and
                               the orientation of the target, at ET.

                 Let LT represent the one-way light time between the
                 observer and the target body's center. The following
                 values of ABCORR apply to the &quot;reception&quot; case in
                 which photons depart from the target body's center at
                 the light-time corrected epoch ET-LT and *arrive* at
                 the observer's location at ET:


                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                               called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                               Newtonian formulation. This correction
                               yields the location of the terminator
                               points at the approximate time they
                               emitted photons arriving at the
                               observer at ET (the difference between
                               light time to the target center and
                               light time to the terminator points
                               is ignored).
 
                               The light time correction uses an
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation. The solution invoked by the
                               'LT' option uses one iteration.

                               The target position as seen by the
                               observer, the position of the light
                               source as seen from the target at
                               ET-LT, and the rotation of the target
                               body, are corrected for light time.

                    'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                               stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This option modifies the
                               positions obtained with the 'LT' option
                               to account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. This correction also
                               applies to the position of the light
                               source relative to the target. The
                               result is the apparent terminator as
                               seen by the observer.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges. The
                               position and rotation of the target
                               body and the position of the light
                               source relative to the target are
                               corrected for light time.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                               and stellar aberration corrections.


     OBSRVR      is the name of the observing body. This is typically
                 a spacecraft, the Earth, or a surface point on the
                 Earth. OBSRVR is case-insensitive, and leading and
                 trailing blanks in OBSRVR are not significant.
                 Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
                 integer ID code for the object. For example both
                 'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate strings that indicate
                 the Earth is the observer.

                    
     NPTS        is the number of terminator points to compute.

     TRGEPC      is the &quot;target epoch.&quot;  TRGEPC is defined as follows:
                 letting LT be the one-way light time between the
                 target center and observer, TRGEPC is either the
                 epoch ET-LT or ET depending on whether the requested
                 aberration correction is, respectively, for received
                 radiation or omitted. LT is computed using the
                 method indicated by ABCORR.

                 TRGEPC is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.


     OBSPOS      is the vector from the center of the target body at
                 epoch TRGEPC to the observer at epoch ET. OBSPOS is
                 expressed in the target body-fixed reference frame
                 FIXREF, which is evaluated at TRGEPC.

                 OBSPOS is returned to simplify various related
                 computations that would otherwise be cumbersome. For
                 example, the vector XVEC from the observer to the
                 Ith terminator point can be calculated via the call

                    CALL <a href="vsub.html">VSUB</a> ( TRMPTS(1,I), OBSPOS, XVEC )

                 To transform the vector OBSPOS from a reference frame
                 FIXREF at time TRGEPC to a time-dependent reference
                 frame REF at time ET, the routine <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> should be
                 called. Let XFORM be the 3x3 matrix representing the
                 rotation from the reference frame FIXREF at time
                 TRGEPC to the reference frame REF at time ET. Then
                 OBSPOS can be transformed to the result REFVEC as
                 follows:

                     CALL <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> ( FIXREF, REF,    TRGEPC, ET, XFORM )
                     CALL <a href="mxv.html">MXV</a>    ( XFORM,  OBSPOS, REFVEC )


     TRMPTS      is an array of points on the umbral or penumbral
                 terminator of the ellipsoid, as specified by the
                 input argument TRMTYP. The Ith point is contained in
                 the array elements

                     TRMPTS(J,I),  J = 1, 2, 3

                 Each terminator point is the point of tangency of a
                 plane that is also tangent to the light source. These
                 associated points of tangency on the light source
                 have uniform distribution in longitude when expressed
                 in a cylindrical coordinate system whose Z-axis is
                 the target center to source center vector. The
                 magnitude of the separation in longitude between the
                 tangency points on the light source is

                    2*Pi / NPTS 

                 If the target is spherical, the terminator points
                 also are uniformly distributed in longitude in the
                 cylindrical system described above. If the target is
                 non-spherical, the longitude distribution of the
                 points generally is not uniform.
                                        
                 The terminator points are expressed in the body-fixed
                 reference frame designated by FIXREF. Units are km.

     1)  If the input frame name FIXREF cannot be mapped
         to a frame ID code, the error SPICE(NOTRANSLATION) is
         signaled.

     2)  If the target name TARGET cannot be mapped
         to a body ID code, the error SPICE(NOTRANSLATION) is
         signaled.

     3)  If the frame designated by FIXREF is not centered
         on the target, the error SPICE(INVALIDFIXREF) is
         signaled.

     4)  If the terminator type is not recognized, the error
         will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.

     5)  If the terminator point count NPTS is not at least 1, the
         error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this
         routine.

     6)  If any of the ellipsoid's semi-axis lengths are non-positive,
         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.

     7)  If the light source has non-positive radius, the error
         will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.

     8)  If the light source intersects the smallest sphere
         centered at the origin and containing the ellipsoid, the
         error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine.

     9)  If radii for the target body or light source are not
         available in the kernel pool, the error will be diagnosed by
         a routine in the call tree of this routine. If radii are
         available but either body does not have three radii, the
         error SPICE(INVALIDCOUNT) will be signaled.

     10) If any SPK look-up fails, the error will be diagnosed by
         a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     Appropriate SPK, PCK, and frame kernels must be loaded by the
     calling program before this routine is called. 

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: ephemeris data for the target, observer, and light
          source must be loaded. If aberration corrections are used,
          the states of all three objects relative to the solar system
          barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris
          data. Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading
          one or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - PCK data: triaxial radii for the target body and
          the light source must be loaded into the kernel pool.
          Typically this is done by loading a text PCK file via
          <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must
          be loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK
          file. 

        - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert
          the observer and target states to the target body-fixed
          frame designated by FIXREF, that definition must be
          available in the kernel pool. Typically the definitions of
          frames not already built-in to SPICE are supplied by loading
          a frame kernel.

     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
     run, NOT every time this routine is called.

     This routine models the boundaries of shadow regions on an
     ellipsoidal target body &quot;illuminated&quot; by a spherical light
     source. Light rays are assumed to travel along straight lines;
     refraction is not modeled.

     Points on the target body's surface are classified according to
     their illumination as follows:

        -  A target surface point X for which no vector from X to any
           point in the light source intersects the target, except at
           X, is considered to be &quot;completely illuminated.&quot;

        -  A target surface point X for which each vector from X to a
           point in the light source intersects the target at points 
           other than X is considered to be &quot;in total shadow.&quot;

        -  All other target points are considered to be in partial 
           shadow.

     In this routine, we use the term &quot;umbral terminator&quot; to denote
     the curve usually called the &quot;terminator&quot;: this curve is the
     boundary of the portion of the target body's surface that lies in
     total shadow. We use the term &quot;penumbral terminator&quot; to denote
     the boundary of the completely illuminated portion of the
     surface.

     In general, the terminator on an ellipsoid is a more complicated
     curve than the limb (which is always an ellipse). Aside from
     various special cases, the terminator does not lie in a plane.

     However, the condition for a point X on the ellipsoid to lie on
     the terminator is simple: a plane tangent to the ellipsoid at X
     must also be tangent to the light source. If this tangent plane
     does not intersect the vector from the center of the ellipsoid to
     the center of the light source, then X lies on the umbral
     terminator; otherwise X lies on the penumbral terminator.

     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine 
     specific arithmetic implementation. 


     1)  Compute sets of umbral and penumbral terminator points on the
         Moon. Perform a consistency check using the solar incidence
         angle at each point. We expect to see a solar incidence angle
         of approximately 90 degrees. Since the solar incidence angle
         is measured between the local outward normal and the
         direction to the center of the Sun, the solar incidence angle
         at an umbral terminator point should exceed 90 degrees by
         approximately the angular radius of the Sun, while the angle
         at a penumbral terminator point should be less than 90
         degrees by that amount.

         This program loads SPICE kernels via a meta-kernel. The 
         meta-kernel used to produce the results shown below is

            KPL/MK

            This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
            example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
            assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
            required by SPICE-based user applications.

            In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
            kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
            current working directory.

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 31-MAR-2014 (NJB) (BVS)

        A correction was made to the Detailed_Output section of 
        the header: the subroutine name <a href="vminus.html">VMINUS</a> was changed to <a href="vsub.html">VSUB</a>.

        The header example program was re-written. The metakernel for
        the example program has been updated, as was the program's
        output.

        Various portions of the header were re-written.

        Updated to save the input body names and ZZBODTRN state
        counters and to do name-ID conversions only if the counters
        have changed.

        Updated to save the input frame name and <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> state counter
        and to do frame name-ID conversion only if the counter has
        changed.
