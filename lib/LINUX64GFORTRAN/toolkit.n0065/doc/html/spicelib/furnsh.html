     FILE       I   SPICE kernel file (text or binary).
     FILSIZ     P   Maximum file name length.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Input">Detailed_Input</a></h4>
<PRE>
     FILE       is a SPICE kernel file.  The file may be either binary
                or text. If the file is a binary SPICE kernel it will
                be loaded into the appropriate SPICE subsystem.  If
                FILE is a SPICE text kernel it will be loaded into the
                kernel pool. If FILE is a SPICE meta-kernel containing
                initialization instructions (through use of the
                correct kernel pool variables), the files specified in
                those variables will be loaded into the appropriate
                SPICE subsystem.

                The SPICE text kernel format supports association of
                names and data values using a &quot;keyword = value&quot;
                format. The keyword-value pairs thus defined are
                called &quot;kernel variables.&quot;  

                While any information can be placed in a text kernel
                file, the following string valued kernel variables are
                recognized by SPICE as meta-kernel keywords:

                     KERNELS_TO_LOAD
                     PATH_SYMBOLS
                     PATH_VALUES

                Each kernel variable is discussed below.

                KERNELS_TO_LOAD   is a list of SPICE kernels to be
                                  loaded into a program.  If file
                                  names do not fit within the kernel
                                  pool 80 character limit, they may be
                                  continued to subsequent array
                                  elements by placing the continuation
                                  character ('+') at the end of an
                                  element and then placing the
                                  remainder of the file name in the
                                  next array element.  (See the
                                  examples below for an illustration
                                  of this technique or consult the
                                  routine <a href="stpool.html">STPOOL</a> for further details.)

                                  You may use one or more PATH_SYMBOL
                                  assignments (see below) to specify
                                  strings to be substituted for some
                                  part of a file name.

                PATH_SYMBOLS      is a list of strings (without
                                  embedded blanks) which if
                                  encountered following the '$'
                                  character will be replaced with the
                                  corresponding PATH_VALUES string.
                                  Note that PATH_SYMBOLS are
                                  interpreted only in values
                                  associated with the KERNELS_TO_LOAD
                                  variable. There must be a one-to-one
                                  correspondence between the values
                                  supplied for PATH_SYMBOLS and
                                  PATH_VALUES. For the purpose of
                                  determining this correspondence, any
                                  path value that is continued over
                                  multiple array elements counts as a
                                  single value.

                PATH_VALUES       is a list of expansions to use when
                                  PATH_SYMBOLS are encountered. If
                                  path values do not fit within the
                                  kernel pool 80 character limit, they
                                  may be continued in the same way as
                                  file names (see the KERNELS_TO_LOAD
                                  description above).

               These kernel pool variables persist within the kernel
               pool only until all kernels associated with the
               variable KERNELS_TO_LOAD have been loaded.  Once all
               specified kernels have been loaded, the variables
               KERNELS_TO_LOAD, PATH_SYMBOLS and PATH_VALUES are
               removed from the kernel pool.

<h4><a name="Parameters">Parameters</a></h4>
<PRE>
     FILSIZ    is the maximum file name length that can be
               accommodated by this routine.

     MAXFIL    is the number of entries that can be stored in <a href="keeper.html">KEEPER</a>'s
               kernel database.  Each time a kernel is loaded via
               <b>FURNSH</b>, a database entry is created for that kernel.
               If a meta-kernel is loaded, a database entry is created
               for the meta-kernel itself and for all files referenced
               in the meta-kernel's KERNELS_TO_LOAD specification.
               Unloading a kernel or meta-kernel deletes database
               entries created when the file was loaded.

               The parameter MAXFIL is an upper bound on number of
               SPICE kernels that can be loaded at any time via the
               <a href="keeper.html">KEEPER</a> interface, but the number of kernels that can be
               loaded may be smaller, since re-loading a loaded kernel
               or meta-kernel results in creation of additional
               database entries.

               Kernels loaded into the <a href="keeper.html">KEEPER</a> system are subject to
               constraints imposed by lower-level subsystems. The
               binary kernel systems (SPK, CK, binary PCK, and EK)
               have their own limits on the maximum number of kernels
               that may be loaded.

               The total number of DAF-based files (this set includes
               SPKs, CKs, and binary PCKs) that may be loaded at any
               time may not exceed 1000.  This limit applies whether
               the files are loaded via <b>FURNSH</b> or lower-level loaders
               such as <a href="spklef.html">SPKLEF</a> or <a href="dafopr.html">DAFOPR</a>.  File access performance
               normally will degrade as the number of loaded kernels
               increases.

               The total number of DAS-based files that may be loaded
               at any time is currently limited to 20 files.

<h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4>
<PRE>
     1) If a problem is encountered while trying to load FILE,
        it will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this
        routine.

     2) If the input FILE is a meta-kernel and some file in the
        KERNELS_TO_LOAD assignment cannot be found, or if an error
        occurs while trying to load a file specified by this
        assignment, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the
        call tree of this routine, and this routine will return. Any
        files loaded prior to encountering the missing file will
        remain loaded.

     3) If an attempt to load a text kernel fails while the kernel is
        being parsed, any kernel variable assignments made before
        the failure occurred will be retained in the kernel pool.

     4) If a PATH_SYMBOLS assignment is specified without a
        corresponding PATH_VALUES assignment, the error
        SPICE(NOPATHVALUE) will be signaled.

     5) If a meta-text kernel is supplied to <b>FURNSH</b> that contains
        instructions specifying that another meta-text kernel be
        loaded, the error SPICE(RECURSIVELOADING) will be signaled.

     6) If the input file name has non-blank length exceeding FILSIZ
        characters, the error SPICE(FILENAMETOOLONG) is signaled.

     7) If the input file is a meta-kernel and some file in the
        KERNELS_TO_LOAD assignment has name length exceeding FILSIZ
        characters, the error SPICE(FILENAMETOOLONG) is signaled.

     8) If the input file is a meta-kernel and some value in the
        PATH_VALUES assignment has length exceeding FILSIZ
        characters, the error SPICE(PATHTOOLONG) is signaled.

     9) If the input file is a meta-kernel and some file in the
        KERNELS_TO_LOAD assignment has, after symbol substitution,
        combined name and path length exceeding FILSIZ characters, the
        error SPICE(FILENAMETOOLONG) is signaled.

    10) The error 'SPICE(BADVARNAME)' signals from a routine in the
        call tree of <b>FURNSH</b> if a kernel pool variable name length
        exceeds MAXLEN characters (defined in pool.f).

     The input FILE is examined and loaded into the appropriate SPICE

     This routine provides a uniform interface to the SPICE kernel
     loading systems.  It allows you to easily assemble a list of
     SPICE kernels required by your application and to modify that set
     without modifying the source code of programs that make use of
     these kernels.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h4>
<PRE>
     Example 1
     ---------

     Load the leapseconds kernel naif0007.tls and the planetary
     ephemeris SPK file de405s.bsp.

        CALL <b>FURNSH</b> ( 'naif0007.tls' )
        CALL <b>FURNSH</b> ( 'de405s.bsp'   )


     Example 2
     ---------

     This example illustrates how you could create a meta-kernel file
     for a program that requires several text and binary kernels.
 
     First create a list of the kernels you need in a text file as
     shown below.

        \begintext

           Here are the SPICE kernels required for my application
           program.

           Note that kernels are loaded in the order listed. Thus we
           need to list the highest priority kernel last.


        \begindata

        KERNELS_TO_LOAD = ( 

              '/home/mydir/kernels/spk/lowest_priority.bsp',
              '/home/mydir/kernels/spk/next_priority.bsp',
              '/home/mydir/kernels/spk/highest_priority.bsp',
              '/home/mydir/kernels/text/leapsecond.ker',
              '/home/mydir/kernels+',
              '/custom+',
              '/kernel_data/constants.ker',
              '/home/mydir/kernels/text/sclk.tsc',
              '/home/mydir/kernels/ck/c-kernel.bc' )


     Note that the file name

        /home/mydir/kernels/custom/kernel_data/constants.ker

     is continued across several lines in the right hand side of the
     assignment of the kernel variable KERNELS_TO_LOAD.

     Once you've created your list of kernels, call <b>FURNSH</b> near the
     beginning of your application program to load the meta-kernel
     automatically at program start up.

        CALL <b>FURNSH</b> ( 'myfile.txt' )

     This will cause each of the kernels listed in your meta-kernel
     to be loaded.


     Example 3
     ---------

     This example illustrates how you can simplify the previous
     kernel list by using PATH_SYMBOLS.


        \begintext

           Here are the SPICE kernels required for my application
           program.

           We are going to let A substitute for the directory that
           contains SPK files; B substitute for the directory that
           contains C-kernels; and C substitute for the directory that
           contains text kernels.  And we'll let D substitute for
           a &quot;custom&quot; directory that contains a special planetary
           constants kernel made just for our mission.

           Note that our PATH_VALUES and the corresponding
           PATH_SYMBOLS must be listed in the same order.


        \begindata

        PATH_VALUES  = ( '/home/mydir/kernels/spk',
                         '/home/mydir/kernels/ck',
                         '/home/mydir/kernels/text',
                         '/home/mydir/kernels/custom/kernel_data' )

        PATH_SYMBOLS = ( 'A',
                         'B',
                         'C',
                         'D'  )

        KERNELS_TO_LOAD = (  '$A/lowest_priority.bsp',
                             '$A/next_priority.bsp',
                             '$A/highest_priority.bsp',
                             '$C/leapsecond.ker',
                             '$D/constants.ker',
                             '$C/sclk.tsc',
                             '$B/c-kernel.bc'         )


     Example 4
     ---------

     This example illustrates continuation of path values. The
     meta-kernel shown here is a modified version of that from
     example 3.
     
        \begintext

           Here are the SPICE kernels required for my application
           program.

           We are going to let A substitute for the directory that
           contains SPK files; B substitute for the directory that
           contains C-kernels; and C substitute for the directory that
           contains text kernels.  And we'll let D substitute for
           a &quot;custom&quot; directory that contains a special planetary
           constants kernel made just for our mission.

           Note that our PATH_VALUES and the corresponding
           PATH_SYMBOLS must be listed in the same order.

           The values for path symbols A and D are continued over
           multiple lines.

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>

     1) A meta-kernel cannot reference another meta-kernel.

     2) Failure during an attempt to load a text kernel or a 
        meta-kernel can result in a subset of the intended kernel
        variables being set or a subset of the intended files
        being loaded. <b>FURNSH</b> does not &quot;clean up&quot; so as to undo the
        effects of a failed load operation.

<h4><a name="Version">Version</a></h4>

    SPICELIB Version 4.1.0, 01-JUL-2014 (NJB) (BVS)

        Updated discussion of partially completed kernel loading.

     Last update was 12-APR-2012 (BVS)

        Changed to use <a href="sepool.html">SEPOOL</a> instead of <a href="stpool.html">STPOOL</a> to reduce loading time
        for large meta-kernels due to n^2 delay in <a href="stpool.html">STPOOL</a>.

    SPICELIB Version 4.0.1, 10-FEB-2010 (EDW)

        Added mention of the restriction on kernel pool variable 
        names to MAXLEN (defined in pool.f) characters or less.

    SPICELIB Version 4.0.0, 02-APR-2009 (NJB)

        Continued path values are now supported. <b>FURNSH</b> now rejects
        file names longer than FILSIZ characters.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.3, 27-APR-2007 (NJB)

        Fixed header typo: added quotes to literal string
        input arguments in example <b>FURNSH</b> calls.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.2, 15-NOV-2006 (NJB)

        Added description of parameter MAXFIL to header.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.1, 29-JUL-2003 (NJB) (CHA)

        Numerous updates to improve clarity.  Some corrections were
        made.

    SPICELIB VERSION 2.0.0, 23-AUG-2001 (WLT)

        Added a call to <a href="cvpool.html">CVPOOL</a> in <b>FURNSH</b> so that watches that are
        triggered are triggered by loading Meta-kernels and not by
        some external interaction with the kernel pool.

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 19-SEP-2000 (WLT)

        Corrected the error message template used
        by ZZLDKER

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.1, 16-DEC-1999 (NJB)

        Documentation fix:  corrected second code example in the
        header of this entry point.  The example previously used the
        kernel variable PATH_NAMES; that name has been replaced with
        the correct name PATH_VALUES.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.0, 01-JUL-1999 (WLT)</PRE>
