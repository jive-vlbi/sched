     TARGET   the string name of a target body.  Optionally, you may
              supply the integer ID code for the object as an
              integer string.  For example both 'MOON' and '301'
              are legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
              target body.

              The target and observer define a position vector
              that points from the observer to the target.

     FIXREF   the string name of the body-fixed, body-centered
              reference frame associated with the target body TARGET.

              The SPICE frame subsystem must recognize the 'fixref'
              name.

     METHOD   the string name of the method to use for the subpoint
              calculation. The accepted values for METHOD:

                 'Near point: ellipsoid'   The sub-observer point
                                           computation uses a
                                           triaxial ellipsoid to
                                           model the surface of the
                                           target body. The
                                           sub-observer point is
                                           defined as the nearest
                                           point on the target
                                           relative to the
                                           observer.

                 'Intercept: ellipsoid'    The sub-observer point
                                           computation uses a
                                           triaxial ellipsoid to
                                           model the surface of the
                                           target body. The
                                           sub-observer point is
                                           defined as the target
                                           surface intercept of the
                                           line containing the
                                           observer and the
                                           target's center.

              The METHOD string lacks sensitivity to case, embedded,
              leading and trailing blanks.

     ABCORR   the string description of the aberration corrections to
              apply to the state evaluations to account for one-way
              light time and stellar aberration.

              Any aberration correction accepted by the SPICE
              routine <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> is accepted here. See the header
              of <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a detailed description of the
              aberration correction options. For convenience,
              the options are listed below:

                 'NONE'     Apply no correction. Returns the &quot;true&quot;
                            geometric state.

                 'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'LT+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time and stellar
                            aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.

                'CN+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time and stellar
                            aberration corrections.

                 'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time and stellar
                            aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.

                 'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time and stellar
                            aberration corrections.

              The ABCORR string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
              and trailing blanks.

     OBSRVR   the string name of an observing body.  Optionally, you
              may supply the ID code of the object as an integer
              string. For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are
              legitimate strings to indicate the observer as Earth.

     CRDSYS   the string name of the coordinate system for which the
              coordinate of interest is a member

     COORD    the string name of the coordinate of interest in CRDSYS

              The supported coordinate systems and coordinate names:

                                     'ALTITUDE'

                 The ALTITUDE coordinates have a constant value
                 of zero +/- roundoff for ellipsoid targets.

                 Limit searches for coordinate events in the GEODETIC
                 and PLANETOGRAPHIC coordinate systems to TARGET bodies
                 with axial symmetry in the equatorial plane, i.e.
                 equality of the body X and Y radii (oblate or prolate
                 spheroids).

     RELATE   the string or character describing the relational
              operator used to define a constraint on the selected
              coordinate of the subpoint vector. The result
              window found by this routine indicates the time intervals
              where the constraint is satisfied. Supported values of
              RELATE and corresponding meanings are shown below:

                 '&gt;'       The coordinate value is greater than the
                           reference value REFVAL.

                 '='       The coordinate value is equal to the
                           reference value REFVAL.

                 '&lt;'       The coordinate value is less than the
                           reference value REFVAL.

                 'ABSMAX'  The coordinate value is at an absolute
                           maximum.

                 'ABSMIN'  The coordinate value is at an absolute
                           minimum.

                 'LOCMAX'  The coordinate value is at a local
                           maximum.

                 'LOCMIN'  The coordinate value is at a local
                           minimum.
              The caller may indicate that the region of interest
              is the set of time intervals where the quantity is
              within a specified measure of an absolute extremum.
              The argument ADJUST (described below) is used to
              specify this measure.

              Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
              interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
              window:  a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
              point of the confinement window.

              The RELATE string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
              and trailing blanks.

     REFVAL   the double precision reference value used together with
              the argument RELATE to define an equality or inequality
              to satisfy by the selected coordinate of the subpoint
              vector. See the discussion of RELATE above for
              further information.

               The units of REFVAL correspond to the type as defined
               by COORD, radians for angular measures, kilometers for
               distance measures.

     ADJUST   a double precision value used to modify searches for
              absolute extrema: when RELATE is set to ABSMAX or ABSMIN
              and ADJUST is set to a positive value, <b>GFSUBC</b> finds
              times when the subpoint position vector coordinate is
              within ADJUST radians/kilometers of the specified
              extreme value.

              For RELATE set to ABSMAX, the RESULT window contains
              time intervals when the position vector coordinate has
              values between ABSMAX - ADJUST and ABSMAX.

              For RELATE set to ABSMIN, the RESULT window contains
              time intervals when the position vector coordinate has
              values between ABSMIN and ABSMIN + ADJUST.

              ADJUST is not used for searches for local extrema,
              equality or inequality conditions.

     STEP     the double precision time step size to use in the search.

              STEP must be short enough to for a search using this step
              size to locate the time intervals where coordinate
              function of the subpoint vector is monotone increasing or
              decreasing. However, STEP must not be *too* short, or
              the search will take an unreasonable amount of time.

              For coordinates other than LONGITUDE and RIGHT ASCENSION,
              the step size must be shorter than the shortest interval,
              within the confinement window, over which the coordinate
              is monotone increasing or decreasing.

              For LONGITUDE and RIGHT ASCENSION, the step size must
              be shorter than the shortest interval, within the
              confinement window, over which either the sin or cos
              of the coordinate is monotone increasing or decreasing.

              The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not
              the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
              precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
              See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for
              details.

              STEP has units of TDB seconds.

     CNFINE   a double precision SPICE window that confines the time
              period over which the specified search is conducted.
              CNFINE may consist of a single interval or a collection
              of intervals.

              In some cases the confinement window can be used to
              greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
              for the desired solution. See the Particulars section
              below for further discussion.

              See the Examples section below for a code example
              that shows how to create a confinement window.

              CNFINE must be initialized by the caller using the
              SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.

     MW       is a parameter specifying the length of the SPICE
              windows in the workspace array WORK (see description
              below) used by this routine.

              MW should be set to a number at least twice as large
              as the maximum number of intervals required by any
              workspace window. In many cases, it's not necessary to
              compute an accurate estimate of how many intervals are
              needed; rather, the user can pick a size considerably
              larger than what's really required.

              However, since excessively large arrays can prevent
              applications from compiling, linking, or running
              properly, sometimes MW must be set according to
              the actual workspace requirement. A rule of thumb
              for the number of intervals NINTVLS needed is

                  NINTVLS  =  2*N  +  ( M / STEP )

              where

                  N     is the number of intervals in the confinement
                        window

                  M     is the measure of the confinement window, in
                        units of seconds

                  STEP  is the search step size in seconds

              MW should then be set to

                  2 * NINTVLS

     NW       is a parameter specifying the number of SPICE windows
              in the workspace array WORK (see description below)
              used by this routine. NW should be set to the
              parameter NWMAX; this parameter is declared in the
              include file gf.inc. (The reason this dimension is
              an input argument is that this allows run-time
              error checking to be performed.)

     WORK     is an array used to store workspace windows. This
              array should be declared by the caller as shown:

                 INCLUDE 'gf.inc'
                    ...

                 DOUBLE PRECISION    WORK ( LBCELL : MW, NWMAX )

              where MW is a constant declared by the caller and
              NWMAX is a constant defined in the SPICELIB INCLUDE
              file gf.inc. See the discussion of MW above.

              WORK need not be initialized by the caller.


     RESULT   a double precision SPICE window which will contain the
              search results. RESULT must be initialized using
              a call to <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>. RESULT must be declared and initialized
              with sufficient size to capture the full set of time
              intervals  within the search region on which the
              specified constraint is satisfied.

              If RESULT is non-empty on input, its contents
              will be discarded before <b>GFSUBC</b> conducts its

     RESULT   the SPICE window of intervals, contained within the

              If the search is for local extrema, or for absolute
              extrema with ADJUST set to zero, then normally each
              interval of RESULT will be a singleton: the left and
              right endpoints of each interval will be identical.

              If no times within the confinement window satisfy the

     CNVTOL   is the convergence tolerance used for finding
              endpoints of the intervals comprising the result
              window. CNVTOL is also used for finding intermediate
              results; in particular, CNVTOL is used for finding the
              windows on which the specified coordinate is increasing
              or decreasing. CNVTOL is used to determine when binary
              searches for roots should terminate: when a root is
              bracketed within an interval of length CNVTOL; the
              root is considered to have been found.

              The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
              by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
              data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
              inferior to their precision.

     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
         that if the step size is non-positive, an error is signaled

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be

     Appropriate SPK and PCK kernels must be loaded by the calling

     This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible interface
     than does the routine <a href="gfevnt.html">GFEVNT</a> for conducting searches for
     subpoint position vector coordinate value events.
     Applications that require support for progress reporting,
     interrupt handling, non-default step or refinement functions, or
     non-default convergence tolerance should call <a href="gfevnt.html">GFEVNT</a> rather than
     this routine.

     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
     within the confinement window when the selected coordinate of
     the subpoint position vector satisfies a caller-specified
     constraint. The resulting set of intervals is returned as a SPICE
     window.

     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
     use of this routine in user applications.


     The Search Process
     ==================

     Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
     routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
     periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified
     coordinate function is monotone increasing and monotone
     decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE
     window. Having found these windows, all of the coordinate
     function's local extrema within the confinement window are known.
     Absolute extrema then can be found very easily.

     Within any interval of these &quot;monotone&quot; windows, there will be at
     most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
     of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
     the union of

        - the set of points where an equality constraint is met
        - the boundary points of the confinement window

     the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
     found easily once the monotone windows have been found.


     Step Size
     =========

     The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step
     search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
     searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
     determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
     change of coordinate will be sampled. Starting at
     the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be taken at each
     step. If a change of sign is found, a root has been bracketed; at
     that point, the time at which the time derivative of the
     coordinate is zero can be found by a refinement process, for
     example, using a binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the coordinate function is monotone:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
     intervals (within the confinement window).

     The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
     of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
     the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
     shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
     of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
     result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
     monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
     state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
     specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
     miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
     shortest solution interval.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target and
     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
     time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine
     involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process
     to locate them. &quot;Roots&quot; are both times when local extrema are
     attained and times when the coordinate function is equal to a
     reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising the
     result window are either endpoints of intervals of the
     confinement window or roots.

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance
     used by this routine is set by the parameter CNVTOL (defined
     in gf.inc).

     The value of CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
     data will be the limiting factor.

     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
     CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>, e.g.

        CALL <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>( tolerance value )

     Call <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
     searches will use the updated tolerance value.

     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be
     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect
     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed.

     Practical use of the coordinate search capability would likely
     consist of searches over multiple coordinate constraints to find
     time intervals that satisfies the constraints. An
     effective technique to accomplish such a search is
     to use the result window from one search as the confinement window
     of the next.

     Longitude and Right Ascension
     =============================

     The cyclic nature of the longitude and right ascension coordinates
     produces branch cuts at +/- 180 degrees longitude and 0-360
     longitude. Round-off error may cause solutions near these branches
     to cross the branch. Use of the SPICE routine <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a> will contract
     solution windows by some epsilon, reducing the measure of the
     windows and eliminating the branch crossing. A one millisecond
     contraction will in most cases eliminate numerical round-off
     caused branch crossings.

     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
     specific arithmetic implementation.

     The examples shown below require a &quot;standard&quot; set of SPICE
     kernels. We list these kernels in a meta kernel named
     '<a href= "standard.html">standard.tm</a>'.

        KPL/MK

           This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
           example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
           assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
           required by SPICE-based user applications.

           In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
           kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
           current working directory.

           The names and contents of the kernels referenced
           by this meta-kernel are as follows:

                             )

      Example(1):

      Find the time during 2007 for which the subpoint position vector
      of the sun on earth in the IAU_EARTH frame lies within a geodetic
      latitude-longitude &quot;box&quot; defined as

         16 degrees &lt;= latitude  &lt;= 17 degrees
         85 degrees &lt;= longitude &lt;= 86 degrees

      This problem requires four searches, each search on one of the
      box restrictions. The user needs also realize the temporal
      behavior of latitude greatly differs from that of the longitude.
      The sub-observer point latitude varies between approximately
      23.44 degrees and -23.44 degrees during the year. The
      sub-observer point longitude varies between -180 degrees and
      180 degrees in one day.
