C
C$ Detailed_Input
C
C     TARG        is the standard NAIF ID code for a target body.
C
C     ET          is the epoch (ephemeris time) at which the state
C                 of the target body is to be computed.
C
C     REF         is the name of the reference frame to
C                 which the vectors returned by the routine should
C                 be rotated. This may be any frame supported by
C                 the SPICELIB subroutine FRMCHG.
C
C     OBS         is the standard NAIF ID code for an observing body.
C
C$ Detailed_Output
C
C     STATE       contains the geometric position and velocity of the
C                 target body, relative to the observing body, at epoch
C                 ET. STATE has six elements: the first three contain
C                 the target's position; the last three contain the
C                 target's velocity. These vectors are transformed into
C                 the specified reference frame. Units are always km
C                 and km/sec.
C
C     LT          is the one-way light time in seconds from the 
C                 observing body to the geometric position of the
C                 target body at the specified epoch.
C
C$ Parameters
C
C     None.
C
C$ Exceptions
C
C     1) If insufficient ephemeris data has been loaded to compute
C        the necessary states, the error SPICE(SPKINSUFFDATA) is
C        signaled.

C
C$ Particulars
C
C     SPKGEO computes the geometric state, T(t), of the target
C     body and the geometric state, O(t), of the observing body
C     relative to the first common center of motion.  Subtracting
C     O(t) from T(t) gives the geometric state of the target
C     body relative to the observer.
C
C
C        CENTER ----- O(t)
C            |      /
C            |     /
C            |    /
C            |   /  T(t) - O(t)
C            |  /
C           T(t)
C
C
C     The one-way light time, tau, is given by
C
C
C               | T(t) - O(t) |
C        tau = -----------------
C                      c
C
C
C     For example, if the observing body is -94, the Mars Observer
C     spacecraft, and the target body is 401, Phobos, then the
C     first common center is probably 4, the Mars Barycenter.
C     O(t) is the state of -94 relative to 4 and T(t) is the
C     state of 401 relative to 4.
C
C     The center could also be the Solar System Barycenter, body 0.
C     For example, if the observer is 399, Earth, and the target
C     is 299, Venus, then O(t) would be the state of 399 relative
C     to 0 and T(t) would be the state of 299 relative to 0.
C
C     Ephemeris data from more than one segment may be required
C     to determine the states of the target body and observer
C     relative to a common center.  SPKGEO reads as many segments
C     as necessary, from as many files as necessary, using files
C     that have been loaded by previous calls to SPKLEF (load
C     ephemeris file).
C
C     SPKGEO is similar to SPKEZ but returns geometric states
C     only, with no option to make planetary (light-time) nor
C     stellar aberration corrections.  The geometric states
C     returned by SPKEZ and SPKGEO are the same.
C
C$ Examples
C
C     The following code example computes the geometric
C     state of the moon with respect to the earth and
C     then prints the distance of the moon from the
C     the earth at a number of epochs.
C
C     Assume the SPK file SAMPLE.BSP contains ephemeris data
C     for the moon relative to earth over the time interval
C     from BEGIN to END.

C$ Version
C
C-    SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 08-JAN-2014 (BVS)
C
C        Updated to save the input frame name and POOL state counter
C        and to do frame name-ID conversion only if the counter has
C        changed.
C
C        Updated to map the input frame name to its ID by first calling
C        ZZNAMFRM, and then calling IRFNUM. The side effect of this
C        change is that now the frame with the fixed name 'DEFAULT'
C        that can be associated with any code via CHGIRF's entry point
C        IRFDEF will be fully masked by a frame with indentical name
C        defined via a text kernel. Previously the CHGIRF's 'DEFAULT'
C        frame masked the text kernel frame with the same name.
C
C        Fixed description of STATE in Detailed Output. Replaced 
C        SPKLEF with FURNSH and fixed errors in Examples.
C
C-    SPICELIB Version 2.4.0, 01-SEP-2005 (NJB)
C
C        Updated to remove non-standard use of duplicate arguments
C        in VADDG calls.
C
C-    SPICELIB Version 2.3.0, 05-JAN-2005 (NJB)
C
C        Tests of routine FAILED() were added.
C
C-    SPICELIB Version 2.2.1, 20-OCT-2003 (EDW)
C
C        Added mention that LT returns in seconds.
C
C-    SPICELIB Version 2.2.0, 11-APR-1997 (WLT)
C
C        The routine was modified to take advantage of the fact
C        that most state transformation are between inertial frames.
C        Looking up a transformation between inertial frames is
C        substantially faster than looking up non-inertial
C        transformations.  Consequently slightly more
C        complex code produces about a 50% increase in speed for
C        many users.
C
C-    SPICELIB Version 2.1.0, 26-JUL-1996 (WLT)
C
C        The routine was upgraded so that potentially redundant
C        computations are not performed.
C
C-    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 19-SEP-1995 (WLT)
C
C        The routine was upgraded so that it can return states
C        relative to rotating frames.
C
C-    SPICELIB Version 1.0.1, 10-MAR-1992 (WLT)
C
C        Comment section for permuted index source lines was added

C
C     This is the idea:
C
C     Every body moves with respect to some center. The center
C     is itself a body, which in turn moves about some other
C     center.  If we begin at the target body (T), follow
C     the chain,
C
C                                   T
C                                     \
C           SSB                        \
C               \                     C[1]
C                \                     /
C                 \                   /
C                  \                 /
C                   \               /
C                  C[3]-----------C[2]
C
C     and avoid circular definitions (A moves about B, and B moves
C     about A), eventually we get the state relative to the solar
C     system barycenter (which, for our purposes, doesn't move).
C     Thus,
C
C        T    = T     + C[1]     + C[2]     + ... + C[n]
C         SSB    C[1]       C[2]       [C3]             SSB
C
C     where
C
C        X
C         Y
C
C     is the state of body X relative to body Y.
C
C     However, we don't want to follow each chain back to the SSB
C     if it isn't necessary.  Instead we will just follow the chain
C     of the target body and follow the chain of the observing body
C     until we find a common node in the tree.
C
C     In the example below, C is the first common node.  We compute
C     the state of TARG relative to C and the state of OBS relative
C     to C, then subtract the two states.
C
C                                   TARG
C                                     \
C           SSB                        \
C               \                       A
C                \                     /            OBS
C                 \                   /              |
C                  \                 /               |

C
C     CTARG contains the integer codes of the bodies in the
C     target body chain, beginning with TARG itself and then
C     the successive centers of motion.
C
C     STARG(1,I) is the state of the target body relative
C     to CTARG(I).  The id-code of the frame of this state is
C     stored in TFRAME(I).
C
C     COBS and SOBS will contain the centers and states of the
C     observing body.  (They are single elements instead of arrays
C     because we only need the current center and state of the
C     observer relative to it.)
C
C     First, we construct CTARG and STARG.  CTARG(1) is
C     just the target itself, and STARG(1,1) is just a zero
C     vector, that is, the state of the target relative
C     to itself.
C
C     Then we follow the chain, filling up CTARG and STARG
C     as we go.  We use SPKSFS to search through loaded
C     files to find the first segment applicable to CTARG(1)
C     and time ET.  Then we use SPKPVN to compute the state
C     of the body CTARG(1) at ET in the segment that was found
C     and get its center and frame of motion (CTARG(2) and TFRAME(2).
C
C     We repeat the process for CTARG(2) and so on, until
C     there is no data found for some CTARG(I) or until we
C     reach the SSB.
C
C     Next, we find centers and states in a similar manner
C     for the observer.  It's a similar construction as
C     described above, but I is always 1.  COBS and SOBS
C     are overwritten with each new center and state,
C     beginning at OBS.  However, we stop when we encounter
C     a common center of motion, that is when COBS is equal
C     to CTARG(I) for some I.
C
C     Finally, we compute the desired state of the target
C     relative to the observer by subtracting the state of
C     the observing body relative to the common node from
C     the state of the target body relative to the common
C     node.
C
C     CTPOS is the position in CTARG of the common node.
C
C     Since the upgrade to use hashes and counter bypass ZZNAMFRM
C     became more efficient in looking up frame IDs than IRFNUM. So the
C     original order of calls "IRFNUM first, NAMFRM second" was
C     switched to "ZZNAMFRM first, IRFNUM second". 
C
C     The call to IRFNUM, now redundant for built-in inertial frames,
C     was preserved to for a sole reason -- to still support the
C     ancient and barely documented ability for the users to associate
C     a frame with the fixed name 'DEFAULT' with any CHGIRF inertial
C     frame code via CHGIRF's entry point IRFDEF.
C
C     Note that in the case of ZZNAMFRM's failure to resolve name and
C     IRFNUM's success to do so, the code returned by IRFNUM for
C     'DEFAULT' frame is *not* copied to the saved code SVREFI (which
C     would be set to 0 by ZZNAMFRM) to make sure that on subsequent
C     calls ZZNAMFRM does not do a bypass (as SVREFI always forced look
C     up) and calls IRFNUM again to reset the 'DEFAULT's frame ID
C     should it change between the calls.
