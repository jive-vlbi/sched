C$Procedure      ORDI ( The ordinal position of an element in a set )
 
      INTEGER FUNCTION ORDI ( ITEM, SET )
 
C$ Abstract
C
C     The function returns the ordinal position of any given item in a
C     set.  If the item does not appear in the set, the function returns
C     zero.

C
C     VARIABLE  I/O  DESCRIPTION
C     --------  ---  --------------------------------------------------
C     ITEM       I   An item to locate within a set.
C     SET        I   A set to search for a given item.
C
C     The function returns the ordinal position of ITEM within the SET.
C
C$ Detailed_Input
C
C     ITEM      Is an INTEGER to be located within a set.
C
C     SET       Is a properly validated SPICELIB set that is to be
C               searched for the occurrence of item.
C
C$ Detailed_Output
C
C     The function returns the ordinal position of ITEM within SET.
C     If ITEM is not an element of SET, the function is returned as 0.

C
C$ Particulars
C
C     A natural ordering can be imposed upon the elements of any
C     SPICELIB set, be it INTEGER, CHARACTER or DOUBLE PRECISION.  For
C     character strings the ASCII collating sequence serves as the
C     ordering relation, for DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER variables
C     the arithmetic ordering is used.
C
C     Given any element of a set, its location within this ordered
C     sequence of elements is called its ordinal position within
C     the set.
C
C     For illustrative purposes suppose that SET represents the set
C
C              { 8, 1, 2, 9, 7, 4, 10 }
C
C     The ordinal position of:     8 is 5
C                                  1 is 1
C                                  2 is 2
C                                  9 is 6
C                                  7 is 4
C                                  4 is 3
C                                 10 is 7
C
C     Given an item of the SET, this routine returns its ordinal
C     position.  If the item is not in the set, this function returns
C     a value of 0.
C
C$ Examples
C
C     Suppose that you wished to find the relative position of a value
C     in a large list of values stored within an array.  Say we want
C     to know the relative position of item I of ARRAY withing the
C     set of values represented in ARRAY.
C
C     The following sequence of subroutine calls would allow you
C     determine the relative position of the value ARRAY(I).
C
C     INTEGER               N
C     PARAMETER           ( N = something useful )
C
C     INTEGER               ARRAY (         N )
C     INTEGER               SET   ( LBCELL: N )
C     INTEGER               I
C
C     INTEGER               NVALID
C     INTEGER               POSITION
C
C
C     set the value of NVALID to be the number of valid elements in the
C     array ARRAY
C
C     CALL MOVEI  ( ARRAY, N,      SET(1) )
C     CALL VALIDI ( N,     NVALID, SET    )
C
C     POSITION = ORDI ( ARRAY(I), SET )
C
C     POSITION now contains the ordinal position of ARRAY(I) within the
C     values represented in the array.
C
C$ Restrictions
C
C     SET must be a validated or empty set.

C
C       If the value of the function RETURN is TRUE upon execution of
C       this module, this function is assigned a default value of
C       either 0, 0.0D0, .FALSE., or blank depending on the type of the
C       function.

C     Standard error handling:
C
      IF ( RETURN() ) THEN
         ORDI = 0
         RETURN
      ELSE
         CALL CHKIN ( 'ORDI' )
      END IF
C
C     Given the structure of sets, there's not much to do.
C
      ORDI = BSRCHI ( ITEM, CARDI(SET), SET(1) )
 
      CALL CHKOUT ( 'ORDI' )
      RETURN
      END
