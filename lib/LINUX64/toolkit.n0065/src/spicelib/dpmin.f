C
C     The function returns the value of the smallest (negative) number
C     that can be represented in a double precision variable.
C
C     This varies from machine to machine. Values for several popular
C     machines are shown below.
C
C     Environment: VAX/VMS, VAX FORTRAN
C     Value:       -1.70141183460469229D+38
C
C     Environment: Sun, Sun FORTRAN
C     Value:       -1.7976931348623D+308
C
C     Environment: IBM PC, MS (Microsoft) FORTRAN 5.0
C     Value:       -1.79769313486231D+308
C
C     Environment: Macintosh, Language Systems FORTRAN 1.2.1
C     Value:       -1.7D+308
C
C     Environment: PC/Linux, Fort77
C     Value:       -1.79769313486231D+308
C

C     Value:       (refer to the code below)
C
C
C     References for the values above are listed in the
C     Literature_References section of the header.
C
C     IBM PC Note:
C
C      Although the Microsoft FORTRAN documentation lists
C      -1.797693134862316D+308 as the minimum negative double precision
C      number, it produced a compilation error. As a result, we changed
C      the number to -1.79769313486231D+308, which did not produce a
C      compilation error.
C
C     DEC Alpha OSF/1 Note:
C
C      NAIF does not own an Alpha nor its accompanying documentation.
C      The value in this routine was supplied by a SPICELIB user who
C      looked the value up in his manual.
C
C     PC/Linux Fort77 Note:
C
C      Value was validated by experiment.  The value is identical to
C      that for the PC/MS Fortran and HP-UX 9000/750, FORTRAN/9000
C      platforms.
C
C$ Parameters
C
C     None.
C
C$ Exceptions
C
C     Error free.
C
C$ Files
C
C     None.
C
C$ Particulars
C
C     The function always returns a constant value, set by the user
C     prior to compilation.
C
C$ Examples
C
C     The following code fragment illustrates the use of DPMIN.
C     Note example that the smallest negative number is not
C     necessarily the negative of the largest positive number.
C
C        C
C        C     The window originally has one interval, from "minus
C        C     infinity" to "plus infinity".
C        C
C              WINDOW(1) =  DPMIN()
C              WINDOW(2) =  DPMAX()
C
C              CALL SCARDD ( 2, WINDOW )
C
C$ Restrictions
