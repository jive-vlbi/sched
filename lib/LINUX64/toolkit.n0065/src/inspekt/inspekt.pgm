C$ Abstract
C
C     This is the main module for the program Inspekt.  Only very
C     high level actions are taken here.  Among these are
C
C        1)  The choice of language that will be used during
C            the program (ENGLISH, FRENCH, GERMAN, etc.)
C
C        2)  The name of the log file for the program
C
C        3)  Setting the choice of command line editor.
C
C        4)  Program name and version number.
C
C        5)  A choice of greeting, command preprocessor and
C            the actual work-horse of the program INSPKN which
C            handles the parsing and actions associated with
C            all user commands.
C
C     This version of the program was adapted from the software
C     written by Bill Taber in February of 1993
C
C     The primary author is Bill Taber (NAIF - JPL)
C
C     Additional support was given by Hester Neilan and Nat Bachman
