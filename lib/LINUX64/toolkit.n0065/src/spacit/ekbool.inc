C     represented by integer or character codes.  The codes and their
C     meanings are listed below.
C
C     Integer code indicating `true':
C
      INTEGER               ITRUE
      PARAMETER           ( ITRUE  =  1 )
 
C
C     Integer code indicating `false':
C
      INTEGER               IFALSE
      PARAMETER           ( IFALSE = -1 )
 
C
C     Character code indicating `true':
C
      CHARACTER*(*)         CTRUE
      PARAMETER           ( CTRUE  = 'T' )
 
C
C     Character code indicating `false':
