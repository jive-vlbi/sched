     INST       indicates the name of an instrument, such as a
                spacecraft-mounted framing camera. The field of view
                (FOV) of the instrument will be used to determine if
                the direction from the observer to a target,
                represented as a ray, is visible with respect to the
                instrument.

                The position of the instrument INST is considered to
                coincide with that of the ephemeris object OBSRVR (see
                description below).

                The size of the instrument's FOV is constrained by the
                following: There must be a vector A such that all of
                the instrument's FOV boundary vectors have an angular
                separation from A of less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians
                (see description below). For FOVs that are circular or
                elliptical, the vector A is the boresight. For FOVs
                that are rectangular or polygonal, the vector A is
                calculated.

                See the header of the SPICELIB routine <a href="getfov.html">GETFOV</a> for a
                description of the required parameters associated with
                an instrument.

                Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
                example, both 'CASSINI_ISS_NAC' and '-82360' are
                accepted. Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string.

     RAYDIR     is the direction vector defining a ray of interest.
                The ray emanates from the location of the ephemeris
                object designated by the input argument OBSRVR and
                is expressed relative to the reference frame
                designated by RFRAME (see descriptions below).

     RFRAME     is the name of the reference frame associated with
                the input ray's direction vector RAYDIR. Note: RFRAME
                does not need to be the instrument's reference frame.

                Since light time corrections are not supported for
                rays, the orientation of the frame is always evaluated
                at the epoch associated with the observer, as opposed
                to the epoch associated with the light-time corrected
                position of the frame center.

                Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
                in the string.

     ABCORR     indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                when computing the ray's direction.

                The supported aberration correction options are:

                   'NONE'          No correction.
                   'S'             Stellar aberration correction,
                                   reception case.
                   'XS'            Stellar aberration correction,
                                   transmission case.

                For detailed information, see the geometry finder
                required reading, gf.req.

                Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
                in the string.

     OBSRVR     is the name of the body from which the target
                represented by RAYDIR is observed. The instrument
                designated by INST is treated as if it were co-located
                with the observer.

                Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
                example, both 'CASSINI' and '-82' are accepted. Case
                and leading or trailing blanks are not significant in
                the string.

     ET         is the observation time in seconds past the J2000
                epoch.

     VISIBL     is .TRUE. if the ray is &quot;visible&quot;, or in the

     MAXVRT     is the maximum number of vertices that may be used
                to define the boundary of the specified instrument's
                field of view.

     MARGIN     is a small positive number used to constrain the
                orientation of the boundary vectors of polygonal
                FOVs. Such FOVs must satisfy the following constraints:

                   1)  The boundary vectors must be contained within
                       a right circular cone of angular radius less
                       than than (pi/2) - MARGIN radians; in other
                       words, there must be a vector A such that all
                       boundary vectors have angular separation from
                       A of less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians.

                   2)  There must be a pair of boundary vectors U, V
                       such that all other boundary vectors lie in
                       the same half space bounded by the plane
                       containing U and V. Furthermore, all other
                       boundary vectors must have orthogonal
                       projections onto a specific plane normal to
                       this plane (the normal plane contains the angle
                       bisector defined by U and V) such that the
                       projections have angular separation of at least
                       2*MARGIN radians from the plane spanned by U
                       and V.

                MARGIN is currently set to 1.D-6.

     See INCLUDE file gf.inc for declarations and descriptions of
     parameters used throughout the GF system.

     1)  If the observer's name cannot be mapped to a NAIF ID code, the
         error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled.

     2)  If the aberration correction flag calls for light time
         correction, the error SPICE(INVALIDOPTION) is signaled.

     3)  If the ray's direction vector is zero, the error
         SPICE(ZEROVECTOR) is signaled.

     4)  If the instrument name INST does not have corresponding NAIF
         ID code, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     5)  If the FOV parameters of the instrument are not present in
         the kernel pool, the error will be diagnosed by routines
         in the call tree of this routine.

     6)  If the FOV boundary has more than MAXVRT vertices, the error
         will be diagnosed by routines in the call tree of this
         routine.

     7)  If the instrument FOV shape is a polygon or rectangle, and
         this routine cannot find a ray R emanating from the FOV
         vertex such that maximum angular separation of R and any FOV
         boundary vector is within the limit (pi/2)-MARGIN radians,
         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of
         this routine. If the FOV is any other shape, the same error
         check will be applied with the instrument boresight vector
         serving the role of R.

     8)  If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute a
         requested state vector, the error will be diagnosed by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine.

     9)  If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,
         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.

     Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
     before this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: ephemeris data for the observer at the time
          ET. If aberration corrections are used, the state of the
          observer relative to the solar system barycenter
          must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.

        - Data defining the reference frame in which the instrument's
          FOV is defined must be available in the kernel pool.
          Additionally the name INST must be associated with an ID
          code.

        - IK data: the kernel pool must contain data such that
          the SPICELIB routine <a href="getfov.html">GETFOV</a> may be called to obtain
          parameters for INST.

     The following data may be required:

        - CK data: if the frame in which the instrument's FOV is
          defined is fixed to a spacecraft, at least one CK file will
          be needed to permit transformation of vectors between that
          frame and the J2000 frame.

        - SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
          kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
          (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
          (TDB).

        - Since the input ray direction may be expressed in any
          frame, additional FKs, CKs, SCLK kernels, PCKs, and SPKs
          may be required to map the direction to the J2000 frame.

     Kernel data are normally loaded via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> once per program run,
     NOT every time this routine is called.

<h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4>

     To treat the target as an ephemeris object rather than a ray, use
     the higher-level SPICELIB routine <a href="fovtrg.html">FOVTRG</a>. <a href="fovtrg.html">FOVTRG</a> may be used to
     determine if ephemeris objects such as Saturn are visible in an
     instrument's FOV at a given time.

     The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
     specific arithmetic implementation.

     1) The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS)
        has been used to measure variations in starlight as
        rings and moons occult Cassini's view of the stars.
        One of these events happened at 2008-054T21:31:55.158 UTC.
        Let's verify that Epsilon CMa (Adhara) was in the
        Cassini UVIS field-of-view at the observation time.
