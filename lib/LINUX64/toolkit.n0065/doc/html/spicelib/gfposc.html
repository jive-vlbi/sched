     TARGET   the string name of a target body.  Optionally, you may
              supply the integer ID code for the object as an
              integer string.  For example both 'MOON' and '301'
              are legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
              target body.

              The target and observer define a position vector
              that points from the observer to the target.

     FRAME    the string name of the reference frame in which to
              perform state look-ups and coordinate calculations.

              The SPICE frame subsystem must recognize the FRAME
              name.

     ABCORR   the string description of the aberration corrections to
              apply to the state evaluations to account for one-way
              light time and stellar aberration.

              Any aberration correction accepted by the SPICE
              routine <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> is accepted here. See the header
              of <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a detailed description of the
              aberration correction options. For convenience,
              the options are listed below:

                 'NONE'     Apply no correction. Returns the &quot;true&quot;
                            geometric state.

                 'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'LT+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time and stellar
                            aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.

                'CN+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time and stellar
                            aberration corrections.

                 'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time and stellar
                            aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.

                 'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time and stellar
                            aberration corrections.

              The ABCORR string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
              and trailing blanks.

     OBSRVR   the string name of an observing body.  Optionally, you
              may supply the ID code of the object as an integer
              string. For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are
              legitimate strings to indicate the observer as Earth.

     CRDSYS   the string name of the coordinate system for which the
              coordinate of interest is a member

     COORD    the string name of the coordinate of interest in CRDSYS

              The supported coordinate systems and coordinate names:

          Coordinate System (CRDSYS)   Coordinates (COORD)  Range

          'RECTANGULAR'              'X'

                                     'LONGITUDE'        [0,2Pi)
                                     'Z'

          'GEODETIC'                 'LONGITUDE'        (-Pi,Pi]
                                     'LATITUDE'         [-Pi/2,Pi/2]
                                     'ALTITUDE'

          'PLANETOGRAPHIC'           'LONGITUDE'        [0,2Pi)
                                     'LATITUDE'         [-Pi/2,Pi/2]
                                     'ALTITUDE'

                                      The ALTITUDE coordinates have a
                                      constant value of zero +/-
                                      roundoff for ellipsoid targets.

          Limit those searches for coordinate events in the GEODETIC
          and PLANETOGRAPHIC coordinate systems to TARGET bodies with
          axial symmetry in the equatorial plane, i.e. equality of
          the body X and Y radii (oblate or prolate spheroids).

          Searches on GEODETIC or PLANETOGRAPHIC coordinates requires
          body shape data, and in the case of PLANETOGRAPHIC
          coordinates, body rotation data.

          The body associated to GEODETIC or PLANETOGRAPHIC
          coordinates is the body center of FRAME.

     RELATE   the string or character describing the relational
              operator used to define a constraint on the selected
              coordinate of the observer-target vector. The result
              window found by this routine indicates the time intervals
              where the constraint is satisfied. Supported values of
              RELATE and corresponding meanings are shown below:

                 '&gt;'       The coordinate value is greater than the
                           reference value REFVAL.

                 '='       The coordinate value is equal to the
                           reference value REFVAL.

                 '&lt;'       The coordinate value is less than the
                           reference value REFVAL.

                 'ABSMAX'  The coordinate value is at an absolute
                           maximum.

                 'ABSMIN'  The coordinate value is at an absolute
                           minimum.

                 'LOCMAX'  The coordinate value is at a local
                           maximum.

                 'LOCMIN'  The coordinate value is at a local
                           minimum.

              The caller may indicate that the region of interest
              is the set of time intervals where the quantity is
              within a specified measure of an absolute extremum.
              The argument ADJUST (described below) is used to
              specify this measure.

              Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
              interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
              window:  a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
              point of the confinement window.

              The RELATE string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
              and trailing blanks.

     REFVAL   the double precision reference value used together with
              the argument RELATE to define an equality or inequality
              to satisfy by the selected coordinate of the observer-
              target vector. See the discussion of RELATE above for
              further information.

              The units of REFVAL correspond to the type as defined
              by COORD, radians for angular measures, kilometers for
              distance measures.

     ADJUST   a double precision value used to modify searches for
              absolute extrema: when RELATE is set to ABSMAX or ABSMIN
              and ADJUST is set to a positive value, <b>GFPOSC</b> finds
              times when the position vector coordinate is within
              ADJUST radians/kilometers of the specified extreme value.

              For RELATE set to ABSMAX, the RESULT window contains
              time intervals when the position vector coordinate has
              values between ABSMAX - ADJUST and ABSMAX.

              For RELATE set to ABSMIN, the RESULT window contains
              time intervals when the position vector coordinate has
              values between ABSMIN and ABSMIN + ADJUST.

              ADJUST is not used for searches for local extrema,
              equality or inequality conditions.

     STEP     the double precision time step size to use in the search.

              STEP must be short enough to for a search using this step
              size to locate the time intervals where coordinate
              function of the position vector is monotone increasing or
              decreasing. However, STEP must not be *too* short, or
              the search will take an unreasonable amount of time.

              For coordinates other than LONGITUDE and RIGHT ASCENSION,
              the step size must be shorter than the shortest interval,
              within the confinement window, over which the coordinate
              is monotone increasing or decreasing.

              For LONGITUDE and RIGHT ASCENSION, the step size must
              be shorter than the shortest interval, within the
              confinement window, over which either the sin or cos
              of the coordinate is monotone increasing or decreasing.

              The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not
              the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
              precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
              See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for
              details.

              STEP has units of seconds.

     CNFINE   a double precision SPICE window that confines the time
              period over which the specified search is conducted.
              CNFINE may consist of a single interval or a collection
              of intervals.

              In some cases the confinement window can be used to
              greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
              for the desired solution. See the Particulars section
              below for further discussion.

              See the Examples section below for a code example
              that shows how to create a confinement window.

              CNFINE must be initialized by the caller using the
              SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.

     MW       is a parameter specifying the length of the SPICE
              windows in the workspace array WORK (see description
              below) used by this routine.

              MW should be set to a number at least twice as large
              as the maximum number of intervals required by any
              workspace window. In many cases, it's not necessary to
              compute an accurate estimate of how many intervals are
              needed; rather, the user can pick a size considerably
              larger than what's really required.

              However, since excessively large arrays can prevent
              applications from compiling, linking, or running
              properly, sometimes MW must be set according to
              the actual workspace requirement. A rule of thumb
              for the number of intervals NINTVLS needed is

                  NINTVLS  =  2*N  +  ( M / STEP )

              where

                  N     is the number of intervals in the confinement
                        window

                  M     is the measure of the confinement window, in
                        units of seconds

                  STEP  is the search step size in seconds

              MW should then be set to

                  2 * NINTVLS

     NW       is a parameter specifying the number of SPICE windows
              in the workspace array WORK (see description below)
              used by this routine. NW should be set to the
              parameter NWMAX; this parameter is declared in the
              include file gf.inc. (The reason this dimension is
              an input argument is that this allows run-time
              error checking to be performed.)

     WORK     is an array used to store workspace windows. This

                 DOUBLE PRECISION    WORK ( LBCELL : MW, NWMAX )

              where MW is a constant declared by the caller and
              NWMAX is a constant defined in the SPICELIB INCLUDE
              file gf.inc. See the discussion of MW above.

              WORK need not be initialized by the caller.

     RESULT   a double precision SPICE window which will contain the

              with sufficient size to capture the full set of time
              intervals within the search region on which the specified
              constraint is satisfied.

              If RESULT is non-empty on input, its contents
              will be discarded before <b>GFPOSC</b> conducts its

     RESULT   the SPICE window of intervals, contained within the

              right endpoints of each interval will be identical.

              If no times within the confinement window satisfy the

     CNVTOL   is the convergence tolerance used for finding

              windows on which the specified coordinate is increasing
              or decreasing. CNVTOL is used to determine when binary
              searches for roots should terminate: when a root is
              bracketed within an interval of length CNVTOL; the
              root is considered to have been found.

              The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found

     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
         that if the step size is non-positive, an error is signaled
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

            - truncation error in time values
            - finite tolerance value
            - errors in computed geometric quantities

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
         RESULT window. One technique to handle such a situation,
         slightly contract RESULT using the window routine <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a>.

     3)  If the window size MW is less than 2 or not an even value,

     4)  If the window size of RESULT is less than 2, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will signal.

     5)  If an error (typically cell overflow) occurs during
         window arithmetic, the error will be diagnosed by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     6)  If the relational operator RELATE is not recognized, an
         error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this

     7)  If the size of the workspace is too small, an error is
         signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     8)  If ADJUST is negative, an error is signaled by a routine in

     Appropriate SPK and PCK kernels must be loaded by the calling

     The following data are required:

          for the targets, observer, and any intermediate objects in
          a chain connecting the targets and observer that cover the
          time period specified by the window CNFINE. If aberration
          corrections are used, the states of target and observer
          relative to the solar system barycenter must be calculable

     This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible interface
     than does the routine <a href="gfevnt.html">GFEVNT</a> for conducting searches for
     observer-target position vector coordinate value events.
     Applications that require support for progress reporting,
     interrupt handling, non-default step or refinement functions,
     or non-default convergence tolerance should call <a href="gfevnt.html">GFEVNT</a> rather
     than this routine.

     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
     within the confinement window when the selected coordinate of
     the observer-target position vector satisfies a caller-specified
     constraint. The resulting set of intervals is returned as a SPICE
     window.

     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
     use of this routine in user applications.


     The Search Process
     ==================

     Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
     routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
     periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified
     coordinate function is monotone increasing and monotone
     decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE
     window. Having found these windows, all of the coordinate
     function's local extrema within the confinement window are known.
     Absolute extrema then can be found very easily.

     Within any interval of these &quot;monotone&quot; windows, there will be at
     most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
     of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
     the union of

        - the set of points where an equality constraint is met
        - the boundary points of the confinement window

     the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
     found easily once the monotone windows have been found.


     Step Size
     =========

     The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step
     search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
     searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
     determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
     change of coordinate will be sampled. Starting at
     the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be taken at each
     step. If a change of sign is found, a root has been bracketed; at
     that point, the time at which the time derivative of the
     coordinate is zero can be found by a refinement process, for
     example, using a binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the coordinate function is monotone:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
     intervals (within the confinement window).

     The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
     of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
     the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
     shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
     of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
     result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
     monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
     state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
     specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
     miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
     shortest solution interval.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target and
     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
     time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine
     involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process
     to locate them. &quot;Roots&quot; are both times when local extrema are
     attained and times when the coordinate function is equal to a
     reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising the
     result window are either endpoints of intervals of the
     confinement window or roots.

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance
     used by this routine is set by the parameter CNVTOL (defined
     in gf.inc).

     The value of CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
     data will be the limiting factor.

     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
     CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>, e.g.

        CALL <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>( tolerance value )

     Call <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
     searches will use the updated tolerance value.

     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be
     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect
     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed.

     Practical use of the coordinate search capability would likely
     consist of searches over multiple coordinate constraints to find
     time intervals that satisfies the constraints. An
     effective technique to accomplish such a search is
     to use the result window from one search as the confinement window
     of the next.

     Longitude and Right Ascension
     =============================

     The cyclic nature of the longitude and right ascension coordinates
     produces branch cuts at +/- 180 degrees longitude and 0-360
     right ascension. Round-off error may cause solutions near these
     branches to cross the branch. Use of the SPICE routine <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a>
     will contract solution windows by some epsilon, reducing the
     measure of the windows and eliminating the branch crossing. A
      one millisecond contraction will in most cases eliminate
      numerical round-off caused branch crossings.

     Example(2):

        A minor modification of the program listed in Example 1; find
        the time during 2007 for which the latitude of the Earth-Sun
        vector in IAU_EARTH frame has the minimum value, i.e. the
        latitude of the Tropic of Capricorn.

        Edit the GFPOSC_T program, assign

           RELATE = 'ABSMIN'

        The program outputs:

           Event time: 2007-DEC-22 06:04:32.630160 (TDB)

     Example(3):

        Find the time during 2007 for which the Z component of the
        Earth-Sun vector in IAU_EARTH frame has value 0, i.e. crosses
        the equatorial plane (this also defines a zero latitude).
        The search should return two times, one for an ascending
        passage and one for descending.

        Edit the GFPOSC_T program above, assign:

           RELATE = '='
           CRDSYS = 'RECTANGULAR'
           COORD  = 'Z'

           Note, this RELATE operator refers to the REFVAL value,
           assigned to 0.D0 for this example.

        The program outputs:

           Event time: 2007-MAR-21 00:01:25.495120 (TDB)
           Event time: 2007-SEP-23 09:46:39.574123 (TDB)

     Example(4):

        Find the times between Jan 1, 2007 and Jan 1, 2008
        corresponding to the apoapsis on the Moon's orbit around the
        Earth (note, the <a href="gfdist.html">GFDIST</a> routine can also perform this search).

        Edit the GFPOSC_T program above, assign:

           This search requires a change in the step size since the
           Moon's orbit about the earth (earth-moon barycenter) has a
           twenty-eight day period. Use a step size something less
           than half that value. In this case, we use twelve days.

           STEP   = <a href="spd.html">SPD</a>() * 12.D0

     Example(5):

        Find times between Jan 1, 2007 and Jan 1, 2008 when the
        latitude (elevation) of the observer-target vector between
        DSS 17 and the Moon, as observed in the DSS 17 topocentric
        (station) frame, exceeds 83 degrees.

        This search uses a step size of four hours since the time
        for all declination zero-to-max-to-zero passes within
        the search window exceeds eight hours.

        This search requires kernels not included in the <a href= "standard.html">standard.tm</a>
        meta kernel.

        The example uses an 83 degree elevation because of its rare
        occurrence and short duration.
