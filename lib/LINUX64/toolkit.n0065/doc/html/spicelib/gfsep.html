     TARG1    the string naming the first body of interest. You can
              also supply the integer ID code for the object as an
              integer string.  For example both 'MOON' and '301'
              are legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
              target body.

     SHAPE1   the string naming the geometric model used to
              represent the shape of the TARG1 body. Models
              supported by this routine:

                'SPHERE'        Treat the body as a sphere with
                                radius equal to the maximum value of
                                BODYnnn_RADII

                'POINT'         Treat the body as a point;
                                radius has value zero.

              The SHAPE1 string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
              and trailing blanks.

     FRAME1   the string naming the body-fixed reference frame
              corresponding to TARG1. <b>GFSEP</b> does not currently use
              this argument's value, its use is reserved for future
              shape models. The value 'NULL' will suffice for
              &quot;POINT&quot; and &quot;SPHERE&quot; shaped bodies.

     TARG2    the string naming the second body of interest. You can
              also supply the integer ID code for the object as an
              integer string.  For example both 'MOON' and '301'
              are legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
              target body.

     SHAPE2   the string naming the geometric model used to
              represent the shape of the TARG2. Models supported by
              this routine:

                'SPHERE'        Treat the body as a sphere with
                                radius equal to the maximum value of
                                BODYnnn_RADII

                'POINT'         Treat the body as a single point;
                                radius has value zero.

              The SHAPE2 string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
              and trailing blanks.

     FRAME2   the string naming the body-fixed reference frame
              corresponding to TARG2. <b>GFSEP</b> does not currently use
              this argument's value, its use is reserved for future
              shape models. The value 'NULL' will suffice for
              &quot;POINT&quot; and &quot;SPHERE&quot; shaped bodies.

     ABCORR   the string description of the aberration corrections
              to apply to the state evaluations to account for
              one-way light time and stellar aberration.

              This routine accepts the same aberration corrections
              as does the SPICE routine <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a>. See the header of
              <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a detailed description of the aberration
              correction options. For convenience, the options are
              listed below:

                 'NONE'     Apply no correction.

                 'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'LT+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time and stellar
                            aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.

                 'CN+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time and stellar
                            aberration corrections.

                 'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time and stellar
                            aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.

                 'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time and stellar
                            aberration corrections.

              The ABCORR string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
              and trailing blanks.

     OBSRVR   the string naming the observing body. Optionally, you
              may supply the ID code of the object as an integer
              string. For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are
              legitimate strings to supply to indicate the
              observer is Earth.

     RELATE   the string identifying the relational operator used to
              define a constraint on the angular separation. The
              result window found by this routine indicates the time
              intervals where the constraint is satisfied. Supported
              values of RELATE and corresponding meanings are shown
              below:

                 '&gt;'      Separation is greater than the reference
                          value REFVAL.

                 '='      Separation is equal to the reference
                          value REFVAL.

                 '&lt;'      Separation is less than the reference
                          value REFVAL.

                'ABSMAX'  Separation is at an absolute maximum.

                'ABSMIN'  Separation is at an absolute  minimum.

                'LOCMAX'  Separation is at a local maximum.

                'LOCMIN'  Separation is at a local minimum.

              The caller may indicate that the region of interest
              is the set of time intervals where the quantity is
              within a specified angular separation of an absolute
              extremum. The argument ADJUST (described below) is used
              to specify this angular separation.

              Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
              interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
              window:  a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
              point of the confinement window.

              The RELATE string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
              and trailing blanks.

     REFVAL   the double precision reference value used together with
              RELATE argument to define an equality or inequality to
              be satisfied by the angular separation between the
              specified target and observer. See the discussion of
              RELATE above for further information.

              The units of REFVAL are radians.

     ADJUST   a double precision value used to modify searches for
              absolute extrema: when RELATE is set to ABSMAX or
              ABSMIN and ADJUST is set to a positive value, <b>GFSEP</b>
              finds times when the angular separation between the
              bodies is within ADJUST radians of the specified
              extreme value.

              For RELATE set to ABSMAX, the RESULT window contains
              time intervals when the angular separation has
              values between ABSMAX - ADJUST and ABSMAX.

              For RELATE set to ABSMIN, the RESULT window contains
              time intervals when the angular separation has
              values between ABSMIN and ABSMIN + ADJUST.

              ADJUST is not used for searches for local extrema,
              equality or inequality conditions.

     CNFINE   a double precision SPICE window that confines the time
              period over which the specified search is conducted.
              CNFINE may consist of a single interval or a collection
              of intervals.

              In some cases the confinement window can be used to
              greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
              for the desired solution. See the Particulars section
              below for further discussion.

              See the Examples section below for a code example
              that shows how to create a confinement window.

              CNFINE must be initialized by the caller using the
              SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.

     STEP     the double precision time step size to use in the
              search.

              STEP must be short enough to for a search using this
              step size to locate the time intervals where the
              specified angular separation function is monotone
              increasing or decreasing. However, STEP must not be
              *too* short, or the search will take an unreasonable
              amount of time.

              The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not
              the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
              precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
              See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for
              details.

              STEP has units of TDB seconds.

     MW       is a parameter specifying the length of the SPICE
              windows in the workspace array WORK (see description
              below) used by this routine.

              MW should be set to a number at least twice as large
              as the maximum number of intervals required by any
              workspace window. In many cases, it's not necessary to
              compute an accurate estimate of how many intervals are
              needed; rather, the user can pick a size considerably
              larger than what's really required.

              However, since excessively large arrays can prevent
              applications from compiling, linking, or running
              properly, sometimes MW must be set according to
              the actual workspace requirement. A rule of thumb
              for the number of intervals NINTVLS needed is

                  NINTVLS  =  2*N  +  ( M / STEP )

              where

                  N     is the number of intervals in the confinement
                        window

                  M     is the measure of the confinement window, in
                        units of seconds

                  STEP  is the search step size in seconds

              MW should then be set to

                  2 * NINTVLS

     NW       is a parameter specifying the number of SPICE windows
              in the workspace array WORK (see description below)
              used by this routine. NW should be set to the
              parameter NWSEP; this parameter is declared in the
              include file gf.inc. (The reason this dimension is

     CNVTOL   is the convergence tolerance used for finding

              windows on which the specified distance is increasing
              or decreasing. CNVTOL is used to determine when binary
              searches for roots should terminate: when a root is

              root is considered to have been found.

              The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found

     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
         that if the step size is non-positive, an error is signaled
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

            - truncation error in time values
            - finite tolerance value
            - errors in computed geometric quantities

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
         RESULT window. One technique to handle such a situation,
         slightly contract RESULT using the window routine <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a>.

     3)  SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) signals if workspace window size, MW,

     5)  SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) signals if result window, RESULT,
         is not at least 2 and an even value.

     6)  If RESULT has insufficient capacity to contain the
         number of intervals on which the specified distance condition
         is met, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     7)  If an error (typically cell overflow) occurs during

     Appropriate SPK and PCK kernels must be loaded by the
     calling program before this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: the calling application must load ephemeris data
          for the targets, observer, and any intermediate objects in
          a chain connecting the targets and observer that cover the
          time period specified by the window CNFINE. If aberration
          corrections are used, the states of target and observer
          relative to the solar system barycenter must be calculable
          from the available ephemeris data. Typically ephemeris data
          are made available by loading one or more SPK files using
          <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
          semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool.
          Typically these data are made available by loading a text
          PCK file using <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - If non-inertial reference frames are used, then PCK
          files, frame kernels, C-kernels, and SCLK kernels may be

     This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible interface
     than does the routine <a href="gfevnt.html">GFEVNT</a> for conducting searches for
     angular separation events. Applications that require support for
     progress reporting, interrupt handling, non-default step or
     refinement functions, or non-default convergence tolerance should
     call <a href="gfevnt.html">GFEVNT</a> rather than this routine.

     This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
     within the confinement window for which the angular separation
     between the two bodies satisfies some defined relationship.
     The resulting set of intervals is returned as a SPICE window.

     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
     use of this routine in user applications.

     The Search Process
     ==================

     Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
     routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
     periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified
     angular separation function is monotone increasing and monotone
     decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE
     window. Having found these windows, all of the angular separation
     function's local extrema within the confinement window are known.
     Absolute extrema then can be found very easily.

     Within any interval of these &quot;monotone&quot; windows, there will be at
     most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
     of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
     the union of

        - the set of points where an equality constraint is met
        - the boundary points of the confinement window

     the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
     found easily once the monotone windows have been found.


     Step Size
     =========

     The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step
     search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
     searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
     determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
     change of angular separation (angular separation rate) will be
     sampled. Starting at the left endpoint of an interval, samples
     will be taken at each step. If a change of sign is found, a
     root has been bracketed; at that point, the time at which the
     angular separation rate is zero can be found by a refinement
     process, for example, using a binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the distance function is monotone:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
     intervals (within the confinement window).

     The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
     of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
     the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
     shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
     of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
     result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
     monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
     state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
     specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
     miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
     shortest solution interval.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target and
     observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
     In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
     picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
     time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine
     involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process
     to locate them. &quot;Roots&quot; are both times when local extrema are
     attained and times when the distance function is equal to a
     reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising the
     result window are either endpoints of intervals of the
     confinement window or roots.

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance
     used by this routine is set by the parameter CNVTOL (defined
     in gf.inc).

     The value of CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
     data will be the limiting factor.

     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
     CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>, e.g.

        CALL <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>( tolerance value )

     Call <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
     searches will use the updated tolerance value.

     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be
     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect
     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed.


     Negative Angular Separation
     ===========================

     For those searches using a SPHERE shape identifier for both
     target bodies, the angular separation function returns a
     negative value when the bodies overlap (occult), e.g.
     a search for an ABSMIN of angular separation in a
     confinement window covering an occultation event will
     return the time when the apparent center of the
     occulting body passes closest to the apparent center of
     the occulted body.


     Elongation
     ===========================

     The angular separation of two targets as seen from an observer
     where one of those targets is the sun is known as elongation.

     1) The kernel files to be used by this routine must be loaded
        (normally using the SPICELIB routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>) before this
        routine is called.

     2) This routine has the side effect of re-initializing the
        angular separation quantity utility package.  Callers may
        need to re-initialize the package after calling this routine.

     3) Due to the current logic implemented in ZZGFSPU, a direct
        search for zero angular separation of two point targets will
        always fails, i.e.,

           RELATE = '='
           REFVAL = 0.D0

        Use RELATE values of 'ABSMIN' or 'LOCMIN' to detect such an
        event(s).

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 05-SEP-2012 (EDW)

        Edit to comments to correct search description.

        Implemented use of ZZHOLDD to allow user to alter convergence
        tolerance.

        Removed the STEP &gt; 0 error check. The <a href="gfsstp.html">GFSSTP</a> call includes
        the check.

        Small text edit for clarity on example code description; full
        date strings replaced abbreviated versions.

        Edits to Example section, proper description of &quot;<a href= "standard.html">standard.tm</a>&quot;
        meta kernel.

        Edits to Exceptions section to improve description of
        exceptions and error signals.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.1, 29-DEC-2009 (EDW)

        Edited argument descriptions. Removed mention of &quot;ELLIPSOID&quot;
        shape from SHAPE1 and SHAPE2 as that option is not yet
        implemented.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.0, 19-FEB-2009 (NJB) (EDW)</PRE>
