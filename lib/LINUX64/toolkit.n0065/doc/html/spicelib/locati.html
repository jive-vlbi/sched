     ID          is an integer array that serves as an identifier
                 for some object.  For example it might be a SPICE
                 id code for a planet or satellite; it might be the
                 instrument id and mode of operation of an instrument.
                 See the examples section for more details.

     IDSZ        is the number of components in the array ID.

     LIST        is an array containing several ID's.  The array
                 should be declared so as to have the same upper
                 bound at least as large as the upper bound used
                 in the declaration of <a href="pool.html">POOL</a>.

     <a href="pool.html">POOL</a>        is a linked list pool that gives the search order
                 for examining LIST to locate ID's.  The declaration
                 of <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> and LIST need to be compatible.  Normally,
                 the declaration should look like this:

                    INTEGER   LIST (IDSZ,         LSTSIZ )
                    INTEGER   <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> (   2, LBPOOL: LSTSIZ )

                 If <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> is declared with the statement

                    INTEGER   <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> (   2, LBPOOL: PSIZE  )

                 then you must make sure that PSIZE is less than
                 or equal to LSTSIZ.

                 <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> should be initialized before the first
                 call to this routine with the SPICE routine
                 <a href="lnkini.html">LNKINI</a>.

     AT          is a value that is set by this routine and that
                 you should never reset yourself.  It points
                 to the head of the linked list used for
                 searching LIST.  Changing AT will destroy the
                 link between <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> and LIST.

                 There is one exception to these restrictions.
                 The first call to this routine that occurs after
                 initializing <a href="pool.html">POOL</a>, AT may have any value. It will
                 be set upon output and from that time on, you should
                 not alter its value except by calling this routine
                 to do so.

<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     AT          on output AT points to the location in LIST
                 of ID.

     PRESNT      is a logical flag.  It indicates whether or not
                 ID was already present in the LIST when this
                 routine was called.  If ID was already in LIST
                 PRESNT is returned with the value TRUE.  Otherwise
                 it is returned with the value FALSE.

     This routine serves as a utility for managing the bookkeeping
     needed when using a local buffering scheme which removes
     the last used item when the local buffer becomes full.

     It is primarily a programming utility.  Unless you are dealing
     with a problem very similar to the one just described, you
     probably shouldn't be using this routine.

     The example below illustrates the intended use of this
     routine.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h4>
<PRE>
     Consider the following programming situation.

     Suppose that a routine is being written that will
     access large amounts of data stored in the SPICE
     kernel pool.  Kernel pool access requires overhead that
     may be prohibitive under some circumstances.  Buffering
     data locally and only fetching data from the kernel pool
     when it has not been buffered locally, may substantially
     improve the performance of the routine being written.

     However, since FORTRAN does not allow dynamic memory allocation
     the local data storage must be set at compile time.  As
     a result the local data buffer might become full during
     an execution of your program.  If data for an item needs
     to be fetched from the kernel pool once the buffer has become
     full, you must either repeatedly call the kernel pool to fetch
     the new data or overwrite some of the data in your local buffer.

     This routine helps with the decisions of which items to
     overwrite.  In addition it always moves the last requested
     item to the head of the index used for searching the buffered
     ID's.  In this way if the same item is needed many times
     in succession, there will be very little overhead associated
     with finding the item.  Thus the routine spends its time
     in computing the desired quantities, not in looking up the
     parameters needed for the computation.

     Below is a fragment of code that illustrates how this routine
     should be used. In the situation outlined above.  We'll suppose
     that we are fetching MDLSIZ double precision numbers from the
     kernel pool that are associated with the item

         'BODYid_MAGMODEL'

     And that we are computing something with this model data.


        INTEGER               MDLSIZ
        PARAMETER           ( MDLSIZ = xxxxxx )

        We'll create room to buffer this data for 8 bodies.


        INTEGER               PSIZE
        PARAMETER           ( PSIZE = 8 )


        The ID's we shall be using are 1-dimensional. They are body
        ID's for planets or and their satellites.

        INTEGER               IDSZ
        PARAMETER           ( IDSZ = 1 )

        INTEGER               AT
        INTEGER               DIM
        INTEGER               LIST   (   IDSZ,  PSIZE        )
        INTEGER               <a href="pool.html">POOL</a>   (      2,  LBPOOL:PSIZE )

        DOUBLE PRECISION      MAGMDL ( MDLSIZ,  PSIZE        )
        DOUBLE PRECISION      MODEL  ( MDLSIZ                )

        LOGICAL               FIRST
        LOGICAL               PRESNT

        SAVE

        DATA                  FIRST / .TRUE. /


        The block below handles initializing the linked list pool.

        IF ( FIRST ) THEN

           FIRST = .FALSE.

           CALL <a href="lnkini.html">LNKINI</a> ( PSIZE, <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> )

        END IF

        See if the data associated with ID has already been
        buffered.

        CALL <b>LOCATI</b> ( ID, IDSZ, LIST, <a href="pool.html">POOL</a>, AT, PRESNT )

        IF ( .NOT. PRESNT ) THEN

           The data has not yet been buffered, look it up.  Normally
           you might want to check to see if the data exists and
           handle things appropriately if it doesn't but this is just
           to give you the idea...

           CALL <a href="bodvcd.html">BODVCD</a> ( ID, 'MAGMODEL', 3, DIM, MAGMDL ( 1, AT ) )

        END IF

        Put the model data into the array MODEL for ease of
        reading the rest of the code.

        CALL MOVED ( MAGMDL(1,AT), MDLSIZ, MODEL )


        Now do whatever processing is needed ....

     There are a few things to note about the code fragment above.
     First the handling of the buffering of data was very easy.
     Second, if this routine is called again using the same ID,
     the buffer will already contain the needed model.  Moreover
     the routine <b>LOCATI</b> will return very quickly because the
     ID will already be at the head of the list indexed by <a href="pool.html">POOL</a>.

     You can also easily add an entry point to this routine that
     will force it to look up data from the kernel pool on the
     next call.  All that needs to be done is re-initialize the
     linked list pool.
