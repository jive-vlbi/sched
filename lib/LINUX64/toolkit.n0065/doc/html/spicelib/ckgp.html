<PRE>
     INST       is the NAIF integer ID for the instrument, spacecraft,
                or other structure for which pointing is requested.
                For brevity we will refer to this object as the
                &quot;instrument,&quot; and the frame fixed to this object as
                the &quot;instrument frame&quot; or &quot;instrument-fixed&quot; frame.

     SCLKDP     is the encoded spacecraft clock time for which
                pointing is requested.

                The SPICELIB routines <a href="scencd.html">SCENCD</a> and <a href="sce2c.html">SCE2C</a> respectively
                convert spacecraft clock strings and ephemeris time to
                encoded spacecraft clock.  The inverse conversions are
                performed by <a href="scdecd.html">SCDECD</a> and <a href="sct2e.html">SCT2E</a>.

     TOL        is a time tolerance in ticks, the units of encoded
                spacecraft clock time.  

                The SPICELIB routine <a href="sctiks.html">SCTIKS</a> converts a spacecraft
                clock tolerance duration from its character string
                representation to ticks.  <a href="scfmt.html">SCFMT</a> performs the inverse
                conversion.

                The C-matrix returned by <b>CKGP</b> is the one whose time
                tag is closest to SCLKDP and within TOL units of
                SCLKDP.  (More in Particulars, below.)

                In general, because using a non-zero tolerance 
                affects selection of the segment from which the
                data is obtained, users are strongly discouraged 
                from using a non-zero tolerance when reading CKs 
                with continuous data. Using a non-zero tolerance
                should be reserved exclusively to reading CKs with 
                discrete data because in practice obtaining data 
                from such CKs using a zero tolerance is often not 
                possible due to time round off. 

     REF        is the desired reference frame for the returned
                pointing.  The returned C-matrix CMAT gives the
                orientation of the instrument designated by INST
                relative to the frame designated by REF.  When a
                vector specified relative to frame REF is left-
                multiplied by CMAT, the vector is rotated to the
                frame associated with INST.  See the discussion of
                CMAT below for details.

                Consult the SPICE document &quot;Frames&quot; for a discussion 
                of supported reference frames.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     CMAT       is a rotation matrix that transforms the components of
                a vector expressed in the reference frame specified by
                REF to components expressed in the frame tied to the
                instrument, spacecraft, or other structure at time
                CLKOUT (see below).

                Thus, if a vector v has components x,y,z in the REF
                reference frame, then v has components x',y',z' in the
                instrument fixed frame at time CLKOUT:

                     [ x' ]     [          ] [ x ]
                     | y' |  =  |   CMAT   | | y |
                     [ z' ]     [          ] [ z ]

                If you know x', y', z', use the transpose of the
                C-matrix to determine x, y, z as follows:

                     [ x ]      [          ]T    [ x' ]
                     | y |  =   |   CMAT   |     | y' |
                     [ z ]      [          ]     [ z' ]
                              (Transpose of CMAT)


     CLKOUT     is the encoded spacecraft clock time associated with
                the returned C-matrix. This value may differ from the
                requested time, but never by more than the input
                tolerance TOL.

                The particulars section below describes the search
                algorithm used by <b>CKGP</b> to satisfy a pointing
                request.  This algorithm determines the pointing
                instance (and therefore the associated time value)
                that is returned.

     FOUND      is true if a record was found to satisfy the pointing
                request.  FOUND will be false otherwise.

     How the tolerance argument is used
     ==================================


     Reading a type 1 CK segment (discrete pointing instances)
     ---------------------------------------------------------

     In the diagram below

        - &quot;0&quot; is used to represent discrete pointing instances
          (quaternions and associated time tags).

        - &quot;( )&quot; are used to represent the end points of the time
          interval covered by a segment in a CK file.

        - SCLKDP is the time at which you requested pointing.
          The location of SCLKDP relative to the time tags of the
          pointing instances is indicated by the &quot;+&quot; sign.

        - TOL is the time tolerance specified in the pointing
          request.  The square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; represent the
          endpoints of the time interval

             SCLKDP-TOL : SCLKDP+TOL

        - The quaternions occurring in the segment need not be
          evenly spaced in time.


     Case 1:  pointing is available
     ------------------------------

                              SCLKDP
                                   \   TOL
                                    | /
                                    |/\
     Your request                [--+--]
                                 .  .  .
     Segment      (0-----0--0--0--0--0--0---0--0------------0--0--0--0)
                                     ^
                                     |
                         <b>CKGP</b> returns this instance.


     Case 2:  pointing is not available
     ----------------------------------

                                                   SCLKDP
                                                      \   TOL
                                                       | /
                                                       |/\
     Your request                                   [--+--]
                                                    .  .  .
     Segment      (0-----0--0--0--0--0--0---0--0--0---------0--0--0--0)


                         <b>CKGP</b> returns no pointing; the output
                         FOUND flag is set to .FALSE.



     Reading a type 2, 3, 4, or 5 CK segment (continuous pointing)
     -------------------------------------------------------------

     In the diagrams below

        - &quot;==&quot; is used to represent periods of continuous pointing.

        - &quot;--&quot; is used to represent gaps in the pointing coverage.

        - &quot;( )&quot; are used to represent the end points of the time
          interval covered by a segment in a CK file.

        - SCLKDP is the time at which you requested pointing.
          The location of SCLKDP relative to the time tags of the
          pointing instances is indicated by the &quot;+&quot; sign.

        - TOL is the time tolerance specified in the pointing
          request.  The square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; represent the
          endpoints of the time interval

             SCLKDP-TOL : SCLKDP+TOL

        - The quaternions occurring in the periods of continuous
          pointing need not be evenly spaced in time.


     Case 1:  pointing is available at the request time
     --------------------------------------------------

                             SCLKDP
                                   \   TOL
                                    | /
                                    |/\
     Your request                [--+--]
                                 .  .  .
                                 .  .  .
                                 .  .  .
     Segment            (==---===========---=======----------===--)
                                    ^
                                    |

                   The request time lies within an interval where
                   continuous pointing is available. <b>CKGP</b> returns
                   pointing at the requested epoch.


     Case 2:  pointing is available &quot;near&quot; the request time
     ------------------------------------------------------

                                    SCLKDP
                                          \   TOL
                                           | /
                                           |/\
     Your request                       [--+--]
                                        .  .  .
     Segment            (==---===========----=======---------===--)

                                             |

                   The request time lies in a gap:  an interval where
                   continuous pointing is *not* available.  <b>CKGP</b>
                   returns pointing for the epoch closest to the
                   request time SCLKDP.


     Case 3:  pointing is not available
     ----------------------------------

                                                 SCLKDP
                                                       \   TOL

     Your request                                    [--+--]
                                                     .  .  .
     Segment            (==---===========----=======---------===--)

                         <b>CKGP</b> returns no pointing; the output
                         FOUND flag is set to .FALSE.



     Tolerance and segment priority
     ==============================
 
     <b>CKGP</b> searches through loaded C-kernels to satisfy a pointing
     request. Last-loaded files are searched first. Individual files
     are searched in backwards order, so that between competing
     segments (segments containing data for the same object, for
     overlapping time ranges), the one closest to the end of the file
     has highest priority. 

     The search ends when a segment is found that can provide pointing
     for the specified instrument at a time falling within the
     specified tolerance on either side of the request time. Within
     that segment, the instance closest to the input time is located
     and returned.

     The following four cases illustrate this search procedure.
     Segments A and B are in the same file, with segment A located
     further towards the end of the file than segment B. Both segments
     A and B contain discrete pointing data, indicated by the number
     0.


     Case 1:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
              Because segment A has the highest priority and can

     Segments that contain continuous pointing data are searched in
     the same manner as segments containing discrete pointing data.
     For request times that fall within the bounds of continuous
     intervals, <b>CKGP</b> will return pointing at the request time. When
     the request time does not fall within an interval, then a time at
     an endpoint of an interval may be returned if it is the closest
     time in the segment to the user request time and is also within
     the tolerance.

     In the following examples, segment A is located further towards
     the end of the file than segment C. Segment A contains discrete
     pointing data and segment C contains continuous data, indicated
     by the &quot;=&quot; character.


     Case 3:  Pointing is not available in the first segment searched.
              Because segment A cannot satisfy the request, segment C
              is searched.

     In the next case, assume that the order of segments A and C in the
     file is reversed:  A is now closer to the front, so data from
     segment C are considered first.


     Case 4:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
              Because segment C has the highest priority and can
              satisfy the request, segment A is not searched.

     The next case illustrates an unfortunate side effect of using 
     a non-zero tolerance when reading multi-segment CKs with
     continuous data. In all cases when the look-up interval 
     formed using tolerance overlaps a segment boundary and 
     the request time falls within the coverage of the lower 
     priority segment, the data at the end of the higher priority
     segment will be picked instead of the data from the lower 
     priority segment.


     Case 5:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
              Because segment C has the highest priority and can
              satisfy the request, segment A is not searched.

     Suppose you have two C-kernel files containing data for the
     Voyager 2 narrow angle camera.  One file contains predict values,
     and the other contains corrected pointing for a selected group
     of images, that is, for a subset of images from the first file.

     The following example program uses <b>CKGP</b> to get C-matrices for a
     set of images whose SCLK counts (un-encoded character string
     versions) are contained in the array SCLKCH.

     If available, the program will get the corrected pointing values.
     Otherwise, predict values will be used.

     For each C-matrix, a unit  pointing vector is constructed
     and printed.

    SPICELIB Version 5.4.0, 23-SEP-2013 (BVS)

        Updated to save the input frame name and <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> state counter
        and to do frame name-ID conversion only if the counter has
        changed.

    SPICELIB Version 5.3.1, 09-JUN-2010 (BVS)

        Header update: description of the tolerance and Particulars
        section were expanded to address some problems arising from
        using a non-zero tolerance.  

    SPICELIB Version 5.3.0, 23-APR-2010 (NJB)

        Bug fix: this routine now obtains the rotation
        from the request frame to the applicable CK segment's
        base frame via a call to <a href="refchg.html">REFCHG</a>. Formerly the routine
        used <a href="frmchg.html">FRMCHG</a>, which required that angular velocity data
        be available for this transformation.

    SPICELIB Version 5.2.0, 25-AUG-2005 (NJB)

        Updated to remove non-standard use of duplicate arguments
        in <a href="mxm.html">MXM</a> call.

    SPICELIB Version 5.1.2, 29-JAN-2004 (NJB) 

        Header update:  description of input argument REF was
        expanded.

    SPICELIB Version 5.1.1, 27-JUL-2003 (CHA) (NJB) 

        Various header corrections were made.

    SPICELIB Version 3.2.0, 23-FEB-1999 (WLT)

        The previous editions of this routine did not properly handle
        the case when TOL was negative.  The routine now returns a
        value of .FALSE. for FOUND as is advertised above.

    SPICELIB Version 3.1.0, 13-APR-1998 (WLT)

        The call to CHKOUT in the case when <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a> returned the
        value TRUE used to check out with the name '<a href="ckgpav.html">CKGPAV</a>'.  This
        has been changed to a <b>CKGP</b>.

    SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 19-SEP-1994 (WLT)

        The routine was upgraded to support non-inertial frames.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.1, 10-MAR-1992 (WLT)

        Comment section for permuted index source lines was added
        following the header.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 30-AUG-1991 (JML)

        The Particulars section was updated to show how the
        search algorithm processes segments with continuous
        pointing data.

        The example program now loads an SCLK kernel.

        <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a> is checked after the call to <a href="irfrot.html">IRFROT</a> to handle the
        case where the reference frame is invalid and the error
        handling is not set to abort.

        <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a> is checked in the DO WHILE loop to handle the case
        where an error is detected by a SPICELIB routine inside the
        loop and the error handling is not set to abort.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.1, 02-NOV-1990 (JML)

        The restriction that a C-kernel file must be loaded
        was explicitly stated.
