<h4><a name="Detailed_Input">Detailed_Input</a></h4>
<PRE>
     TARGET   the string name of a target body.  Optionally, you may
              supply the integer ID code for the object as an
              integer string.  For example both 'MOON' and '301'
              are legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
              target body.

              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant
              in the string TARGET.

     ILLMN    the string name of the illuminating body. This will
              normally be 'SUN' but the algorithm can use any
              ephemeris object

              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant
              in the string ILLMN.

     ABCORR   the string description of the aberration corrections to
              apply to the state evaluations to account for one-way
              light time and stellar aberration.

              This routine accepts only reception mode aberration
              corrections. See the header of <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a detailed
              description of the aberration correction options.
              For convenience, the allowed aberation options are
              listed below:

                 'NONE'     Apply no correction. Returns the &quot;true&quot;
                            geometric state.

                 'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'LT+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                            one-way light time and stellar
                            aberration using a Newtonian
                            formulation.

                 'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.

                'CN+S'      &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                            Newtonian light time and stellar
                            aberration corrections.

              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant
              in the string ABCORR.

     OBSRVR   the string name of an observing body.  Optionally, you
              may supply the ID code of the object as an integer
              string. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate
              strings that indicate the Moon is the observer.

              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant
              in the string OBSRVR.

     RELATE   the string or character describing the relational
              operator that defines the constraint on the
              phase angle of the observer-target vector. The result
              window found by this routine indicates the time intervals
              where the constraint is satisfied. Supported values of
              RELATE and corresponding meanings are shown below:

                 '&gt;'       The phase angle value is greater than the
                           reference value REFVAL.

                 '='       The phase angle value is equal to the
                           reference value REFVAL.

                 '&lt;'       The phase angle value is less than the
                           reference value REFVAL.

                 'ABSMAX'  The phase angle value is at an absolute
                           maximum.

                 'ABSMIN'  The phase angle value is at an absolute
                           minimum.

                 'LOCMAX'  The phase angle value is at a local
                           maximum.

                 'LOCMIN'  The phase angle value is at a local
                           minimum.

              The caller may indicate that the region of interest
              is the set of time intervals where the quantity is
              within a specified measure of an absolute extremum.
              The argument ADJUST (described below) is used to
              specify this measure.

              Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
              interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
              window:  a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
              point of the confinement window.

              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
              significant in the string RELATE.

     REFVAL   the double precision reference value used together with
              the argument RELATE to define an equality or inequality
              to satisfy by the phase angle of the observer-target
              vector. See the discussion of RELATE above for
              further information.

              The units of REFVAL are radians.

     ADJUST   a double precision value used to modify searches for
              absolute extrema: when RELATE is set to ABSMAX or ABSMIN
              and ADJUST is set to a positive value, <b>GFPA</b> finds
              times when the phase angle is within
              ADJUST radians of the specified extreme value.

              For RELATE set to ABSMAX, the RESULT window contains
              time intervals when the phase angle has
              values between ABSMAX - ADJUST and ABSMAX.

              For RELATE set to ABSMIN, the RESULT window contains
              time intervals when the phase angle has
              values between ABSMIN and ABSMIN + ADJUST.

              ADJUST is not used for searches for local extrema,
              equality or inequality conditions.

     STEP     the double precision time step size to use in the search.

              STEP must be short enough for a search using this step
              size to locate the time intervals where the phase angle
              function is monotone increasing or decreasing. However,
              STEP must not be *too* short, or the search will take an
              unreasonable amount of time.

              The choice of STEP affects the completeness but not
              the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
              precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
              See the discussion of the parameter CNVTOL for
              details.

              STEP has units of TDB seconds.

     CNFINE   a double precision SPICE window that confines the time
              period over which the specified search is conducted.
              CNFINE may consist of a single interval or a collection
              of intervals.

              In some cases the confinement window can be used to
              greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
              for the desired solution. See the Particulars section
              below for further discussion.

              See the Examples section below for a code example
              that shows how to create a confinement window.

              CNFINE must be initialized by the caller using the
              SPICELIB routine <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>.

     MW       is a parameter specifying the length of the SPICE
              windows in the workspace array WORK (see description
              below) used by this routine.

              MW should be set to a number at least twice as large
              as the maximum number of intervals required by any
              workspace window. In many cases, it's not necessary to
              compute an accurate estimate of how many intervals are
              needed; rather, the user can pick a size considerably
              larger than what's really required.

              However, since excessively large arrays can prevent
              applications from compiling, linking, or running
              properly, sometimes MW must be set according to
              the actual workspace requirement. A rule of thumb
              for the number of intervals NINTVLS needed is

                  NINTVLS  =  2*N  +  ( M / STEP )

              where

                  N     is the number of intervals in the confinement
                        window

                  M     is the measure of the confinement window, in
                        units of seconds

                  STEP  is the search step size in seconds

              MW should then be set to

                  2 * NINTVLS

     NW       is a parameter specifying the number of SPICE windows
              in the workspace array WORK (see description below)
              used by this routine. NW should be set to the
              parameter NWPA; this parameter is declared in the
              include file gf.inc. (The reason this dimension is
              an input argument is that this allows run-time
              error checking to be performed.)

     WORK     is an array used to store workspace windows. This
              array should be declared by the caller as shown:

                 INCLUDE 'gf.inc'
                    ...

                 DOUBLE PRECISION    WORK ( LBCELL : MW, NWPA )

              where MW is a constant declared by the caller and
              NWPA is a constant defined in the SPICELIB INCLUDE
              file gf.inc. See the discussion of MW above.

              WORK need not be initialized by the caller.

     RESULT   a double precision SPICE window that will contain the
              search results. RESULT must be initialized using
              a call to <a href="ssized.html">SSIZED</a>. RESULT must be declared and initialized
              with sufficient size to capture the full set of time
              intervals within the search region on which the specified
              constraint is satisfied.

              If RESULT is non-empty on input, its contents
              will be discarded before <b>GFPA</b> conducts its
              search.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     WORK     the input workspace array, modified by this
              routine.

     RESULT   the SPICE window of intervals, contained within the
              confinement window CNFINE, on which the specified
              constraint is satisfied.

              If the search is for local extrema, or for absolute
              extrema with ADJUST set to zero, then normally each
              interval of RESULT will be a singleton: the left and
              right endpoints of each interval will be identical.

              If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
              constraint, RESULT will return with a cardinality of
              zero.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Parameters">Parameters</a></h4>
<PRE>
     LBCELL   the integer value defining the lower bound for
              SPICE Cell arrays (a SPICE window is a kind of cell).

     CNVTOL   is the default convergence tolerance used for finding
              endpoints of the intervals comprising the result
              window. CNVTOL is also used for finding intermediate
              results; in particular, CNVTOL is used for finding the
              windows on which the phase angle is increasing
              or decreasing. CNVTOL is used to determine when binary
              searches for roots should terminate: when a root is
              bracketed within an interval of length CNVTOL; the
              root is considered to have been found.

              The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
              by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
              data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
              inferior to their precision.

     See INCLUDE file gf.inc for declarations and descriptions of
     parameters used throughout the GF system.

<h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4>
<PRE>
     1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
         the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
         Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
         roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
         to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
         roots.

         This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
         that if the step size is non-positive, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDSTEP) is signaled.

     2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

            - truncation error in time values
            - finite tolerance value
            - errors in computed geometric quantities

         it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
         satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
         RESULT window. One technique to handle such a situation,
         slightly contract RESULT using the window routine <a href="wncond.html">WNCOND</a>.

     3)  SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) signals if workspace window size, MW,
         is not at least 2 and an even value.

     4)  SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) signals if workspace window count,
         NW, is not at least NWPA.

     5)  SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) signals if result window, RESULT,
         is not at least 2 and an even value.

     6)  If RESULT has insufficient capacity to contain the
         number of intervals on which the specified angle condition
         is met, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     7)  If an error (typically cell overflow) occurs during
         window arithmetic, the error will be diagnosed by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     8)  If the relational operator RELATE is not recognized, an
         error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
         routine.

     9)  If ADJUST is negative an error is signaled from a routine in
         the call tree of this routine.

         A non-zero value for ADJUST when RELATE has any value other
         than &quot;ABSMIN&quot; or &quot;ABSMAX&quot; causes the error SPICE(INVALIDVALUE)
         to signal from a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     10) If any of the input body names, TARGET, ILLMN, OBSRVR, do
         not map to NAIF ID codes, an error is signaled by a routine
         in the call tree of this routine.

     11) If the input body names, TARGET, ILLMN, OBSRVR, are not
         distinct, an error is signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     12) If required ephemerides or other kernel data are not
         available, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.

     13) An error signals from a routine in the call tree of
         this routine for any transmit mode aberration correction.

     This routine determines if the caller-specified constraint
     condition on the geometric event (phase angle) is satisfied for
     any time intervals within the confinement window CNFINE. If one
     or more such time intervals exist, those intervals are added
     to the RESULT window.

     This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible interface
     than does the routine <a href="gfevnt.html">GFEVNT</a> for conducting searches for
     illuminator-target-observer phase angle value events.
     Applications that require support for progress reporting,
     interrupt handling, non-default step or refinement functions
     should call <a href="gfevnt.html">GFEVNT</a> rather than this routine.

     Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
     solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
     use of this routine in user applications.


     The Search Process
     ==================

     Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
     routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
     periods, within the confinement window, over which the
     phase angle function is monotone increasing and monotone
     decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE
     window. Having found these windows, all of the phase angle
     function's local extrema within the confinement window are known.
     Absolute extrema then can be found very easily.

     Within any interval of these &quot;monotone&quot; windows, there will be at
     most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
     of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
     the union of

        - the set of points where an equality constraint is met
        - the boundary points of the confinement window

     the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
     found easily once the monotone windows have been found.


     Step Size
     =========

     The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step
     search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
     searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
     determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
     change of phase angle will be sampled. Starting at
     the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be taken at each
     step. If a change of sign is found, a root has been bracketed; at
     that point, the time at which the time derivative of the
     phase angle is zero can be found by a refinement process, for
     example, using a binary search.

     Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
     of the intervals over which the phase angle function is monotone:
     the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
     intervals (within the confinement window).

     The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
     of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
     the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
     shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
     of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
     result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
     monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
     state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
     specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
     miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
     shortest solution interval.

     Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target,
     illumination source, and observer can be a valuable aid in
     picking a reasonable step size. In general, the user can
     compensate for lack of such knowledge by picking a very short
     step size; the cost is increased computation time.

     Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
     the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
     That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


     Convergence Tolerance
     =====================

     As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine
     involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process
     to locate them. &quot;Roots&quot; are both times when local extrema are
     attained and times when the geometric quantity function is equal
     to a reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising
     the result window are either endpoints of intervals of the
     confinement window or roots.

     Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
     narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
     This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
     has been determined to within an error margin called the
     &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance
     used by this routine is set by the parameter CNVTOL (defined
     in gf.inc).

     The value of CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
     tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
     solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
     data will be the limiting factor.

     The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
     CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>, e.g.

        CALL <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a>( tolerance value )

     Call <a href="gfstol.html">GFSTOL</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
     searches will use the updated tolerance value.

     Setting the tolerance tighter than CNVTOL is unlikely to be
     useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
     Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
     since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
     cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect
     on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


     The Confinement Window
     ======================

     The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
     interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
     confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
     more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
     to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
     slow search of interest must be performed.
