     TARG        is the NAIF ID code for a target body.  The target
                 and observer define a state vector whose position
                 component points from the observer to the target.

     ET          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past
                 J2000 TDB, at which the state of the target body
                 relative to the observer is to be computed. ET
                 refers to time at the observer's location.

     REF         is the inertial reference frame with respect to which
                 the input state STOBS and the output state STARG are
                 expressed. REF must be recognized by the SPICE
                 Toolkit. The acceptable frames are listed in the
                 Frames Required Reading, as well as in the SPICELIB
                 routine <a href="chgirf.html">CHGIRF</a>.

                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string
                 REF.
 

     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
                 the state of the target body to account for one-way
                 light time. See the discussion in the Particulars
                 section for recommendations on how to choose
                 aberration corrections.
                  
                 If ABCORR includes the stellar aberration correction
                 symbol '+S', this flag is simply ignored. Aside from
                 the possible presence of this symbol, ABCORR may be
                 any of the following:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the 
                               geometric state of the target body 
                               relative to the observer.  

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                               called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                               Newtonian formulation. This correction
                               yields the state of the target at the
                               moment it emitted photons arriving at
                               the observer at ET.
 
                               The light time correction involves
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation (see Particulars for details).
                               The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                               uses one iteration.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges (three
                               iterations on all supported platforms).
                               Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                               substantially more accurate than the
                               'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                               of the participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed. See the Particulars section of
                               <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a discussion of precision of
                               light time corrections.

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
                 the observer's location at ET and arrive at the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET+LT:

                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This correction yields the
                               state of the target at the moment it
                               receives photons emitted from the
                               observer's location at ET.

                    'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged 
                               Newtonian light time correction.


                 Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
                 accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
                 by this routine.

                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string
                 ABCORR.


     STOBS       is the geometric (uncorrected) state of the observer
                 relative to the solar system barycenter at epoch ET.
                 STOBS is a 6-vector: the first three components of
                 STOBS represent a Cartesian position vector; the last
                 three components represent the corresponding velocity
                 vector. STOBS is expressed relative to the inertial
                 reference frame designated by REF.

                 Units are always km and km/sec.
                                 
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     STARG       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position
                 and velocity of the target body relative to the
                 specified observer. STARG is corrected for the
                 specified aberration, and is expressed with respect
                 to the specified inertial reference frame.  The first
                 three components of STARG represent the x-, y- and
                 z-components of the target's position; last three
                 components form the corresponding velocity vector.

                 The position component of STARG points from the
                 observer's location at ET to the aberration-corrected
                 location of the target. Note that the sense of the
                 position vector is independent of the direction of
                 radiation travel implied by the aberration
                 correction.

                 Units are always km and km/sec.

     LT          is the one-way light time between the observer and
                 target in seconds.  If the target state is corrected
                 for light time, then LT is the one-way light time 
                 between the observer and the light time-corrected 
                 target location.

     DLT         is the derivative with respect to barycentric
                 dynamical time of the one way light time between
                 target and observer:

                    DLT = d(LT)/d(ET)

                 DLT can also be described as the rate of change of 
                 one way light time. DLT is unitless, since LT and
                 ET both have units of TDB seconds.

                 If the observer and target are at the same position,
                 then DLT is set to zero.

     1) For the convenience of the caller, the input aberration
        correction flag can call for stellar aberration correction via
        inclusion of the '+S' suffix. This portion of the aberration
        correction flag is ignored if present.

     2) If the value of ABCORR is not recognized, the error
        is diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this
        routine.

     3) If the reference frame requested is not a recognized
        inertial reference frame, the error SPICE(BADFRAME)
        is signaled.

     4) If the state of the target relative to the solar system
        barycenter cannot be computed, the error will be diagnosed 
        by routines in the call tree of this routine.

     5) If the observer and target are at the same position,
        then DLT is set to zero. This situation could arise,
        for example, when the observer is Mars and the target
        is the Mars barycenter.

     6) If a division by zero error would occur in the computation
        of DLT, the error SPICE(DIVIDEBYZERO) is signaled.

     This routine computes states using SPK files that have been
     loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading
     interface routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.  Application programs typically load
     kernels once before this routine is called, for example during
     program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly.
     See the routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading
     for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels.

     If any of the ephemeris data used to compute STARG are expressed
     relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those
     data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference
     frame transformations required to compute the state. Normally
     these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels. Any
     such kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is
     called.

     This routine supports higher-level SPK API routines that can
     perform both light time and stellar aberration corrections.
     User applications normally will not need to call this routine
     directly.

     See the header of the routine <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a detailed discussion
     of aberration corrections.

     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine 
     specific arithmetic implementation. 

    1) Look up a sequence of states of the Moon as seen from the
       Earth. Use light time corrections. Compute the first state for
       the epoch 2000 JAN 1 12:00:00 TDB; compute subsequent states at
       intervals of 1 hour. For each epoch, display the states, the
       one way light time between target and observer, and the rate of
       change of the one way light time.

       Use the following meta-kernel to specify the kernels to 
       load:

     C
     C        Now compute the desired state vector:

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>
<PRE>
     1) The routine <a href="spkgeo.html">SPKGEO</a> should be used instead of this routine
        to compute geometric states. <a href="spkgeo.html">SPKGEO</a> introduces less
        round-off error when the observer and target have common 
        center that is closer to both objects than is the solar
        system barycenter.

     2) The kernel files to be used by <b>SPKLTC</b> must be loaded
        (normally by the SPICELIB kernel loader <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>) before 
        this routine is called.

     3) Unlike most other SPK state computation routines, this
        routine requires that the output state be relative to an
        inertial reference frame.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 04-JUL-2014 (NJB)

        Discussion of light time corrections was updated. Assertions
        that converged light time corrections are unlikely to be
        useful were removed.

     Last update was 02-MAY-2012 (NJB)

        Updated to ensure convergence when CN or XCN light time
        corrections are used. The new algorithm also terminates early
        (after fewer than three iterations) when convergence is
        attained.

        Call to ZZPRSCOR was replaced by a call to ZZVALCOR.
