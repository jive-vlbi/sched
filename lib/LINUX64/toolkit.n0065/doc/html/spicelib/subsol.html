     METHOD      is a short string specifying the computation method
                 to be used.  The choices are:

                    'Near point'       The sub-solar point is defined
                                       as the nearest point on the
                                       target to the sun. 

                    'Intercept'        The sub-observer point is
                                       defined as the target surface
                                       intercept of the line
                                       containing the target's center
                                       and the sun's center.
                    
                 In both cases, the intercept computation treats the
                 surface of the target body as a triaxial ellipsoid.
                 The ellipsoid's radii must be available in the kernel
                 pool.

                 Neither case nor white space are significant in 
                 METHOD.  For example, the string ' NEARPOINT' is 
                 valid.                 


     TARGET      is the name of the target body.  TARGET is
                 case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
                 TARGET are not significant. Optionally, you may
                 supply a string containing the integer ID code for
                 the object.  For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
                 legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
                 target body.

                 This routine assumes that the target body is modeled
                 by a tri-axial ellipsoid, and that a PCK file
                 containing its radii has been loaded into the kernel
                 pool via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.


     ET          is the epoch in ephemeris seconds past J2000 at which
                 the sub-solar point on the target body is to be
                 computed.


     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                 when computing the observer-target state.  ABCORR
                 may be any of the following.

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                               geometric sub-solar point on the target
                               body.

                    'LT'       Correct for planetary (light time)
                               aberration.  Both the state and rotation
                               of the target body are corrected for one
                               way light time from target to observer.

                               The state of the sun relative to the 
                               target is corrected for one way light
                               from the sun to the target; this state
                               is evaluated at the epoch obtained by
                               retarding ET by the one way light time
                               from target to observer.

                    'LT+S'     Correct for planetary (light time) and
                               stellar aberrations.  Light time 
                               corrections are the same as in the 'LT'
                               case above.  The target state is 
                               additionally corrected for stellar
                               aberration as seen by the observer, and
                               the sun state is corrected for stellar
                               aberration as seen from the target. 

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges (three
                               iterations on all supported platforms).
                               Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                               substantially more accurate than the
                               'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                               of the participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed. See the Particulars section
                               of <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a discussion of precision
                               of light time corrections. Light time
                               corrections are applied as in the 'LT'
                               case.
                      
                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                               corrections and stellar aberration
                               correction. Light time and stellar
                               aberration corrections are applied as
                               in the 'LT+S' case.


     OBSRVR      is the name of the observing body, typically a
                 spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the
                 earth.  OBSRVR is case-insensitive, and leading and
                 trailing blanks in OBSRVR are not significant.
                 Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
                 integer ID code for the object.  For example both
                 'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate strings that indicate
                 the earth is the observer.

     SPOINT      is the sub-solar point on the target body at ET
                 expressed relative to the body-fixed frame of the
                 target body.

                 The sub-solar point is defined either as the point on
                 the target body that is closest to the sun, or the
                 target surface intercept of the line containing the
                 target's center and the sun's center; the input 
                 argument METHOD selects the definition to be used.

                 The body-fixed frame, which is time-dependent, is
                 evaluated at ET if ABCORR is 'NONE'; otherwise the
                 frame is evaluated at ET-LT, where LT is the one way
                 light time from target to observer.

                 The state of the target body is corrected for 
                 aberration as specified by ABCORR; the corrected 
                 state is used in the geometric computation.  As 
                 indicated above, the rotation of the target is 
                 retarded by one way light time if ABCORR specifies
                 that light time correction is to be done.
    
                 The state of the sun as seen from the observing 
                 body is also corrected for aberration as specified
                 by ABCORR.  The corrections, when selected, are
                 applied at the epoch ET-LT, where LT is the one way
                 light time from target to observer.

     If any of the listed errors occur, the output arguments are 
     left unchanged.
 

     1) If the input argument METHOD is not recognized, the error
        SPICE(DUBIOUSMETHOD) is signaled.

     2) If either of the input body names TARGET or OBSRVR cannot be
        mapped to NAIF integer codes, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND)
        is signaled.

     3) If OBSRVR and TARGET map to the same NAIF integer ID codes, the
        error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled.  

     4) If frame definition data enabling the evaluation of the state 
        of the target relative to the observer in target body-fixed
        coordinates have not been loaded prior to calling <b>SUBSOL</b>, the
        error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
        tree of this routine.   

     5) If the specified aberration correction is not recognized, the
        error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
        tree of this routine.

     6) If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to 
        calling <b>SUBSOL</b>, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a 
        routine in the call tree of this routine.  

     7) If the triaxial radii of the target body have not been loaded
        into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>SUBSOL</b>, the error will be
        diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of this 
        routine.   

     8) The target must be an extended body:  if any of the radii of 
        the target body are non-positive, the error will be diagnosed
        and signaled by routines in the call tree of this routine.
 
     9) If PCK data supplying a rotation model for the target body 
        have not been loaded prior to calling <b>SUBSOL</b>, the error will be
        diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of this 
        routine.

     Appropriate SPK, PCK, and frame data must be available to 
     the calling program before this routine is called.  Typically
     the data are made available by loading kernels; however the
     data may be supplied via subroutine interfaces if applicable.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data:  ephemeris data for sun, target, and observer must 
          be loaded.  If aberration corrections are used, the states of
          sun, target, and observer relative to the solar system 
          barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris
          data. Ephemeris data are made available by loading
          one or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - PCK data:  triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded
          into the kernel pool.  Typically this is done by loading a 
          text PCK file via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Further PCK data:  a rotation model for the target body must
          be loaded.  This may be provided in a text or binary PCK
          file which is loaded via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Frame data:  if a frame definition is required to convert
          the sun, observer, and target states to the body-fixed frame
          of the target, that definition must be available in the 
          kernel pool.  Typically the definition is supplied by loading
          a frame kernel via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
     run, NOT every time this routine is called.

     <b>SUBSOL</b> computes the sub-solar point on a target body, as seen by
     a specified observer.

     There are two different popular ways to define the sub-solar
     point:  &quot;nearest point on target to the sun&quot; or &quot;target surface
     intercept of line containing target and sun.&quot;  These coincide
     when the target is spherical and generally are distinct otherwise.

     When comparing sub-point computations with results from sources
     other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same geometric
     definitions are used.

    SPICELIB Version 1.3.0, 04-JUL-2014 (NJB)(BVS)

        Discussion of light time corrections was updated. Assertions
        that converged light time corrections are unlikely to be
        useful were removed.

     Last update was 19-SEP-2013 (BVS)

        Updated to save the input body names and ZZBODTRN state
        counters and to do name-ID conversions only if the counters
        have changed.

    SPICELIB Version 1.2.3, 18-MAY-2010 (BVS) 

        Index line now states that this routine is deprecated.

    SPICELIB Version 1.2.2, 17-MAR-2009 (EDW) 

        Typo correction in Required_Reading, changed 
        FRAME to FRAMES.

    SPICELIB Version 1.2.1, 07-FEB-2008 (NJB) 

        Abstract now states that this routine is deprecated.

    SPICELIB Version 1.2.0, 24-OCT-2005 (NJB) 

        Call to <a href="bodvar.html">BODVAR</a> was replaced with call to <a href="bodvcd.html">BODVCD</a>.

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 22-JUL-2004 (NJB) 

        Updated to support representations of integers in the input
        arguments TARGET and OBSRVR.   Deleted references in header to
        kernel-specific loaders. Made miscellaneous minor corrections
        to header comments.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.2, 12-DEC-2002 (NJB)

        Corrected and updated code example in header.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.1, 1-NOV-1999 (WLT)

        Declared routine <a href="ltime.html">LTIME</a> to be external.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.0, 03-SEP-1999 (NJB) (JEM)</PRE>
