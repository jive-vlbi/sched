*****  Long before 2014:

This directory contains a few subroutine libraries that have been
imported to SCHED but which are not recreated by the makefile.  The
input source code is likely not in the SCHED distribution.

The libraries included are:

The LINUX NAIF libraries for 64 bit Linux machines compiled
with g77.  I have not yet tried to make a gfortran version.  The code
and tools for recreating these libraries for version N0051 are in the
$SCHED/RELATED_CODE/NAIF directory.  That directory is not maintained
with svn nor, for reasons of bulk, is it included with SCHED
distributions.

The PGPLOT libraries and data files are in the $SCHED/PGPLOT subdirectories
rather than here to avoid having too many.

The 32 bit Linux NAIF libraries were deleted on May 2, 2014.


****  Jan. 22, 2015 RCW

The NAIF libraries were updated by Bruce Rowen from a fresh download
from JPL.  They are no longer the ones built from the area described
above.  The new ones are version N0064.  Bruce has the build stuff.
