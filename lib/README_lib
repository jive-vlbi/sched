This directory contains a few subroutine libraries that have been
imported to SCHED but which are not recreated by the makefile.  The
input source code is likely not in the SCHED distribution.

The libraries included are:

The LINUX NAIF libraries for 64 bit Linux machines compiled
with g77.  I have not yet tried to make a gfortran version.  The code
and tools for recreating these libraries are in the
$SCHED/RELATED_CODE/NAIF directory.  That directory is not maintained
with svn nor, for reasons of bulk, is it included with SCHED
distributions.

The PGPLOT libraries and data files are in the $SCHED/PGPLOT subdirectories
rather than here to avoid having too many.

The 32 bit Linux NAIF libraries were deleted on May 2, 2014.
