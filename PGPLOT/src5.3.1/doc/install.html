<H1>Installation Instructions</H1>

<p>These instructions are for <I>Version 5.3.1</I> of PGPLOT.</P>

<p>To install PGPLOT, you need to perform the following steps. These
steps are described more fully below for each operating system.</P>

<p>Read the <A HREF="ver531.html">release notes</A> 
to see what is new in this version.</p>

<OL>
<LI>Download the distribution file. This is
a gzipped tar archive:<BR>
<A HREF="../downloads/pgplot531.tar.gz"><code>pgplot531.tar.gz</code></A>.


<LI>Unpack the distribution file to create the &ldquo;PGPLOT
distribution&rdquo; directory tree. This is identical for all
implementations of PGPLOT and can be placed on any disk that is
visible on the target system, including read-only network-mounted
disks.

<LI>Create a writable directory in which the PGPLOT library and
associated files will be created. One such directory is needed for
each different operating system and compiler combination (&ldquo;target
system&rdquo;) that you wish to support. This should not be the same
directory as the directory containing the source code.

<LI>Configure PGPLOT by selecting device drivers from the available
list.

<LI>Execute the supplied scripts and makefiles to create the library
and demonstration programs.

<LI>Install the optional C binding for PGPLOT, which provides a
convenient way to call PGPLOT subroutines from a program written in C
or C++. This requires an ANSI C compiler (that understands function
prototypes) and is not available on all systems.

<LI>Run the demonstration programs on your selected devices and verify
that they run satisfactorily.

<LI>Install the optional documentation files.</LI>

</OL>

<p>You will need the following software, which is not distributed with PGPLOT:</p>
<UL>
<LI>A Fortran-77 compiler for your computer system.<P>
Consult your operating system vendor to see what Fortran-77 compilers
are available for your system.  A useful index of Fortran compilers can be found at <i>The Fortran Market</i> web site (<A HREF="http://www.fortran.com/fortran/compilers.html">http://www.fortran.com/fortran/compilers.html</A>).
The following are widely used;<UL>
<LI>GNU Fortran compiler (g77): <A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/ (g77-*).</A>
<LI>f2c Fortran-77 to C translator: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.netlib.org/f2c/">ftp://ftp.netlib.org/f2c/</A>.</UL>
I prefer g77, which works well on the systems I have tried. f2c is
unable to compile many of the PGPLOT device drivers that use
non-standard extensions to Fortran-77.

<LI>An ANSI C compiler for your computer system.
<LI>Utilities for retrieving and unpacking the distribution file: <code>tar</code>, and <code>gunzip</code>.
<LI>To use the PGPLOT X-window device drivers: the X Window System for your computer, including the standard X header files (<code>*.h</code>) and the Xlib library.
<LI>To use the PGPLOT Motif (X-window) widget driver: the X Window System, the Xm and Xt libraries, and associated header files.
<LI>To use the PGPLOT Tcl/Tk (X-window) widget driver: the X Window System, the tk and tcl libraries, and associated header files.
</UL>

<p>Detailed installation instructions are available for the following
operating systems:</p>
