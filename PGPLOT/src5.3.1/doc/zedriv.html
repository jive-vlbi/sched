<DT>Obtaining hardcopy
<DD> On Starlink print the file on the queue

<PRE>
$ PRINT/NOFEED/QUE=ZETA PGPLOT.ZET
</PRE>
To stop a Zeta plot job, once it has been started, use the buttons on
the plotter.  Press PAUSE, NEXT PLOT and CLEAR.  Only after this
sequence is it safe to delete the job from the ZETA Queue. Failing to
press the NEXT PLOT button will not correctly advance the paper. 
Failing to press CLEAR but, deleteing the current job can prevent the
following plot from being plotted.
