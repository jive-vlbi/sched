<h1>Attributes</h1>

<p>The appearance of the primitive elements of a graphical image
(lines, graph-markers, text, and area-fill) can be changed by
specifying <i>primitive attributes</i>. The attributes, and the
corresponding routines for changing them, are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Color Index:</b> <a href="subroutines.html#PGSCI">
PGSCI</a>.</li>

<li><b>Color Representation:</b> <a href="subroutines.html#PGSCR">
PGSCR</a>, <a href="subroutines.html#PGSCRN">PGSCRN</a>, and <a
href="subroutines.html#PGSHLS">PGSHLS</a>.</li>

<li><b>Line Style:</b> <a href="subroutines.html#PGSLS">
PGSLS</a>.</li>

<li><b>Line Width:</b> <a href="subroutines.html#PGSLW">
PGSLW</a>.</li>

<li><b>Character Height:</b> <a href="subroutines.html#PGSCH">
PGSCH</a>.</li>

<li><b>Character Font:</b> <a href="subroutines.html#PGSCF">
PGSCF</a>.</li>

<li><b>Text Background:</b> <a href="subroutines.html#PGSTBG">
PGSTBG</a>.</li>

<li><b>Fill-area Style:</b> <a href="subroutines.html#PGSFS">
PGSFS</a>, <a href="subroutines.html#PGSHS">PGSHS</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The routines to change attributes can be freely intermixed with
the PGPLOT drawing routines. Once an attribute has been changed by
a call to the appropriate routine, it remains in effect for all
subsequent plotting until it is changed again. In addition to the
routines that set attributes (PGS<i>xx</i>) there are routines for
determining the current value of each attribute (PGQ<i>xx</i>).
These make it possible to write subroutines which change attribute
values temporarily but restore the old attributes before returning
to the calling program.</p>

<h2>Color Index</h2>

<p>This attribute affects all the primitives: lines, graph-markers,
text, and area-fill, and is controlled by routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSCI">PGSCI</a>.</p>

<p>Devices differ considerably in their ability to draw in more
than one color. On most hardcopy devices, the default color is
black on a white background, while on most CRT devices, it is white
on a black background. Color is selected using an integer parameter
called the <i>color index</i>. Color index 1 is the default color,
and color index 0 is the background color. The number of different
color indices available depends on the device. On most monochrome
devices, only color indices 0 and 1 are available, while some color
CRT devices may permit color indices from 0 to 255. On some
monochrome devices, color index can be used to select different
brightnesses (intensities).</p>

<p>Color index 0, the background color, can be used to &ldquo;erase&rdquo;
elements from a picture by overwriting them with color index 0.
Note that not all devices are capable of this: e.g., Tektronix
storage-tube terminals and pen-plotters cannot erase part of a
displayed picture.</p>

<p>To select a new color index for subsequent plotting, use routine
<a href="subroutines.html#PGSCI">PGSCI</a> (Set Color Index). For
example, the following code fragment draws a line using color index
2 and some markers using color index 3:</p>

<pre class="f">
    CALL PGSCI(2)
    CALL PGLINE(100, XL, YL)
    CALL PGSCI(3)
    CALL PGPT(15, XP, YP, 17)
</pre>

<pre class="c">
    cpgsci(2);
    cpgline(100, xl, yl);
    cpgsci(3);
    cpgpt(15, xp, yp, 17);
</pre>

<p>The <i><a href="device-manual.html">PGPLOT Device Manual</a></i>
lists the capabilities of the devices for plotting in color and
variable intensity. The default color index is 1; all devices
accept this. Most devices also accept color index 0 (background or
erase), and several accept color index up to 15 or more. The
maximum color index is the number of different colors that can be
displayed at once. Some devices permit the assignment of colors to
color indices to be changed (by calling <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSCR">PGSCR</a>, see below). The range of color
indices available on the active device can be determined by calling
routine <a href="subroutines.html#PGQCOL">PGQCOL</a>. The lower
limit is always either 0 or 1, and the upper limit can be in the
range 1 to 255.</p>

<h2>Color Representation</h2>

<p>Each color index has an associated <i>Color Representation</i>,
which defines the associated color and intensity. Color
Representation may be expressed by a set of three numbers, either
the Hue, Lightness, and Saturation (H,L,S) components or the Red,
Green, and Blue (R,G,B) components. (R,G,B) are quantities in the
range 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being maximum intensity; if R=G=B the
color is a shade of gray. In the (H,L,S) system, hue is a cyclic
quantity expressed as an angle in the range 0 to 360, while L and S
are in the range 0.0 to 1.0.</p>

<p>The following table and <a href="#FIG51">Figure 5.1</a> show how
the color indices are defined on most devices when PGPLOT is
started. Note that these assignments are device-dependent, and in
particular some devices plot in black on white background (color
index 0 = white, color index 1 = black), while others plot in white
on black background (color index 0 = black, color index 1 = white).
Color indices 0-15 have these predefined color representations, but
these may be changed with by calling PGSCR, PGSCRN, or PGSHLS.
Color indices 16-maximum have no predefined representations: if
these indices are used, one of these routines must be called to
define the representation.</p>

</pre>
</div>

<p>On some devices, but not all, the assignments of colors to color
indices can be changed by calling routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSCR">PGSCR</a>, to specify the color in terms
of its (R,G,B) components, <a href="subroutines.html#PGSHLS">
PGSHLS</a>, to specify the color in terms of its (H,L,S)
components, or <a href="subroutines.html#PGSCRN">PGSCRN</a>, to
specify the color by name. Note that color-index 0, the background
color, can be redefined in this way.</p>

<p>The effect of changing color representation is device-dependent.
Devices usually fall into one of three classes: static color
(unchangeable representation), pseudo-color (color lookup table),
and direct color. On static color devices (e.g., pen plotters,
Printronix printer, Tektronix terminal), attempts to change the
color representation are ignored. On pseudo-color devices (e.g.,
most X Window devices), changing the color representation of index
J changes the lookup table. Pixels already drawn with index J
change to the new color, as do subsequent ones. On direct color
devices (e.g., PostScript color printers, some X Window devices),
changing color representation only affects the color of pixels
drawn with that color index later in the program.</p>

<p>On monochrome devices which can display a range of intensities,
the displayed intensity I is calculated from the requested (R,G,B)
intensities by the following formula:</p>

<p>I = 0.30 R + 0.59 G + 0.11 B</p>

<p>as in the NTSC encoding used by US color television systems.</p>


<h3>Setting Color Representation in the RGB System</h3>

<p>Use routine <a href="subroutines.html#PGSCR">PGSCR</a>, which
requires red, green, and blue values in the range 0.0 (dark) to 1.0
(maximum intensity). The following example changes color index 2 to
dark blue:</p>

<pre class="f">
    CALL PGSCR(2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3)
</pre>

<pre class="c">
    cpgscr(2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3);
</pre>

<p>Note that most devices do not have an infinite range of colors
or monochrome intensities available; the nearest available color is
used. Examples: for black, set R = G = B = 0.0; for white, set R =
G = B = 1.0; for medium gray, set R = G = B = 0.5; for medium
yellow, set R = G = 0.5, B = 0.0.</p>

<h3>Setting Color Representation in the HLS System</h3>

<p>The HLS, or Hue-Saturation-Lightness, system is an alternative
to RGB for specifying color representation. Use routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSHLS">PGSHLS</a> instead of PGSCR. Hue is
represented by an angle in degrees, with red at 120, green at 240,
and blue at 0 (or 360). Lightness ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with
black at lightness 0.0 and white at lightness 1.0. Saturation
ranges from 0.0 (gray) to 1.0 (pure color). Hue is irrelevant when
saturation is 0.0.</p>

<pre>
 Examples:           H     L     S        R     G     B
     black          any   0.0   0.0      0.0   0.0   0.0
     white          any   1.0   0.0      1.0   1.0   1.0
     medium gray    any   0.5   0.0      0.5   0.5   0.5
     red            120   0.5   1.0      1.0   0.0   0.0
     yellow         180   0.5   1.0      1.0   1.0   0.0
     pink           120   0.7   0.8      0.94  0.46  0.46

<h3>Setting Color Representation by Name</h3>

<p>A third alternative to PGSCR and PGSHLS is routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSCRN">PGSCRN</a>, which specifies color by
name. For example,</p>

<pre class="f">
    CALL PGSCRN(2, 'MediumOrchid', IER)
</pre>

<pre class="c">
    cpgscrn(2, "MediumOrchid", &amp;ier);
</pre>

<p>The name is converted to R, G, B intensities by consulting an
external file which is read the first time that PGSCRN is called.
The name of the external file is found as follows:</p> 

<ol>
<li>if environment variable (logical name) <code>PGPLOT_RGB</code>
is defined, its value is used as the file name;</li>

<li>otherwise, if environment variable <code>PGPLOT_DIR</code> is
defined, a file <code>rgb.txt</code> in the directory named by this
environment variable is used;</li>

<li>otherwise, file <code>rgb.txt</code> in the current directory
is used.</li>

<li>If all of these fail to find a file, an error is reported and
the routine does nothing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each line of the file defines one color, with four blank- or
tab-separated fields per line. The first three fields are the R, G,
B components, which are integers in the range 0 (zero intensity) to
255 (maximum intensity). The fourth field is the color name. The
color name may include embedded blanks. The file <a href="rgb.txt">
<code>rgb.txt</code></a> distributed with PGPLOT is based on the
standard list of color names supported by the X-window system. To see
how the colors will appear on your system, print or view the <a
href="pgplot_color_chart.pdf">PGPLOT Color Chart</a> (a PDF file).</p>

<p>The color name in PGSCRN can be replaced by a hexadecimal code,
e.g., '#ff0000'. The hexadecimal code consists of 7 characters; the
first is '#', and the remaining 6 characters are pairs of
hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, upper or lower case) giving R, G, B
components for the color in the range 00 (black) to ff (maximum)
(0-255 decimal). This convention is widely used to specify colors,
e.g., in Web browsers.</p>


<h3>Setting Background and Foreground colors at run time</h3>

<p>The device-dependent default color representation of color indices
0 (background) and 1 (foreground) can be overridden at run time by
defining environment variables <code>PGPLOT_BACKGROUND</code> and
<code>PGPLOT_FOREGROUND</code>. The values of these variables are
color names, as used by routine PGSCRN. For example, to ensure that
all devices use a black foreground on a white background, on a
UNIX/csh system, type </p>

<pre>
    setenv PGPLOT_FOREGROUND black 
    setenv PGPLOT_BACKGROUND white
</pre>

<p>before running the PGPLOT program. Or you can be more creative,
e.g., </p>

<pre>
    setenv PGPLOT_FOREGROUND gold
    setenv PGPLOT_BACKGROUND #2040C0
</pre>

<p>On direct color devices (e.g., PostScript), it is necessary to fill
the view surface with the background color (by calling routine <a
href="subroutines.html#PGERAS">PGERAS</a>) for a change in color
representation to affect the whole view surface. </p>

<h2>Line Style</h2>

<p>Line Style can be, e.g., solid, dashed, or dotted. The attribute
affects only lines, not the other primitives. It is controlled by
subroutine <a href="subroutines.html#PGSLS">PGSLS</a>. The default
line style is a full, unbroken line. Line style is described by an
integer code: </p>

<ul>
<li>1: full line,</li>

<li>2: long dashes,</li>

<li>3: dash-dot-dash-dot,</li>

<li>4: dotted,</li>

<li>5: dash-dot-dot-dot.</li>
</ul>

<p>To change the line style, use routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSLS">PGSLS</a>. For example, to draw a dashed
line: </p>

<pre class="f">
CALL PGSLS(2)
CALL PGLINE(620, X, Y)
CALL PGSLS(1)
</pre>

<pre class="c">
cpgsls(2);
cpgline(620, x, y);
cpgsls(1);
</pre>

<h2>Line Width</h2>

<p>Line Width affects lines, graph-markers, and text. It is
specified with routine <a href="subroutines.html#PGSLW">PGSLW</a>,
which takes an <i>integer</i> argument specifying the line-width
multiplier. The exact appearance of thick lines is
device-dependent---it depends on the resolution of the device---but
on most devices PGPLOT attempts to make the line-width unit equal
to 0.005 inches (0.13 mm). The default width is 1, and the maximum
that may be specified is 201. Requesting a line-width of 10, say,
will give lines that are approximately 1/20 inch thick. e.g.,</p>

<pre class="f">
CALL PGSLW(5)
</pre>

<pre class="c">
cpgslw(5);
</pre>

<h2>Character Height</h2>

<p>Character Height affects graph-markers and text. Character
height is specified as a multiple of the default character height;
the default character height one-fortieth of the height or width of
the view surface (whichever is less). To change the character
height, use routine <a href="subroutines.html#PGSCH">PGSCH</a>.
Note that the argument is a <i>real</i> [<i>float</i>] variable or
constant, not an integer like the other attribute routines. The
following example is part of the program used to draw Figure
4.2:</p>

<pre class="f">
CALL PGSCH(1.5)
CALL PGSLW(3)
CALL PGTEXT(0.05,10.0,'Bigger (1.5)')
CALL PGSCH(0.5)
CALL PGSLW(1)
CALL PGTEXT(0.5,10.0,'Smaller (0.5)')
CALL PGSCH(1.0)
</pre>

<pre class="c">cpgsch(1.5);
cpgslw(3);
cpgtxt(0.05, 10.0, "Bigger (1.5)");
cpgsch(0.5);
cpgslw(1);
cpgtxt(0.5, 10.0, "Smaller (0.5)");
cpgsch(1.0);
</pre>

<h2>Character Font</h2>

<p>Character Font affects text only. Four fonts are available. The
default font (1) is simple and is the fastest to draw. The font is
defined by an integer code:</p>

<ul>
<li>1: normal (simple) font (default),</li>

<li>2: roman font,</li>

<li>3: italic font,</li>

<li>4: script font.</li>
</ul>

<p>To change the character font, use routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSCF">PGSCF</a>; it is also possible to change
the font temporarily by using escape sequences (see Chapter 4). For
example, the following code generates text in roman font:</p>

<pre class="f">
INTEGER ROMAN
PARAMETER (ROMAN=2)
...
CALL PGSCF(ROMAN)
CALL PGTEXT(X, Y, 'SPQR')
</pre>

<pre class="c">
#define ROMAN 2
...
cpgscf(ROMAN);
cpgtext(x, y, "SPQR");
</pre>

<h2>Text Background</h2>

<p>This attribute affects the appearance of text. Text may be
either <i>transparent</i> (the default), in which case underlying
graphics show between the characters of the text, or <i>opaque</i>,
in which case the bounding box of the text is filled with a
specified color before drawing the text characters. Use routine <a
href="subroutines.html#PGSTBG">PGSTBG</a> to specify the text
background; the argument is an integer which may be</p>

<ul>
<li>-1: to select transparent text (the default), or</li>

<li>0 - 255: to select opaque text, with the argument specifying
the color index of the text background. Use color index 0 to erase
underlying graphics before drawing text.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the color index specified by PGSTBG is the same as that
specified by PGSCI, then text will be written on a background of
the same color and will be unreadable.</p>

<p>The following code draws yellow text on a blue background:</p>

<pre class="f">
INTEGER YELLOW, BLUE
PARAMETER (BLUE=4, YELLOW=7)
...
CALL PGSCI(YELLOW)
CALL PGSTBG(BLUE)
CALL PGTEXT(X, Y, 'SPQR')
</pre>

<pre class="c">#define BLUE 4
#define YELLOW 7
...
cpgsci(YELLOW);
cpgstbg(BLUE);
cpgtext(x, y, "SPQR");
</pre>

<h2>Fill-Area Style</h2>

<p>Fill-Area Style can be <i>solid</i> (fill the area with the
current color), <i>outline</i> (only the outline of the polygon is
drawn), <i>hatched</i> (the region is shaded with parallel lines)
or <i>cross-hatched</i> (the region is shaded with two sets of
perpendicular lines). The style is defined by an integer code:</p>

<ul>
<li>1: solid (default),</li>

<li>2: outline,</li>

<li>3: hatched,</li>

<li>4: cross-hatched.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are illustrated in <a href="#FIG52">Figure 5.2</a>.</p>

<p>Fill-area style applies to polygons (<a href=
"subroutines.html#PGPOLY">PGPOLY</a>), circles (<a href=
"subroutines.html#PGCIRC">PGCIRC</a>), and rectangles (<a href=
"subroutines.html#PGRECT">PGRECT</a>).</p>

<p>To change the fill-area style, use routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSFS">PGSFS</a>. The following example uses both
outline and solid fill: it first erases a rectangle (using color
index 0 and fill-area style 1), and then draws a frame around it
(using color index 1 and fill-area style 2):</p>

<pre class="f">
CALL PGSCI(0)
CALL PGSFS(1)
CALL PGRECT(0.31, 0.69, 0.85, 0.97)
CALL PGSCI(1)
CALL PGSFS(2)
CALL PGRECT(0.31, 0.69, 0.85, 0.97)
</pre>

<pre class="f">
cpgsci(0);
cpgsfs(1);
cpgrect(0.31, 0.69, 0.85, 0.97);
cpgsci(1);
cpgsfs(2);
cpgrect(0.31, 0.69, 0.85, 0.97);
</pre>

<p>The spacing and orientation of the hatching lines in styles 3
and 4 can be changed by calling routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSHS">PGSHS</a>.</p>

<h2>The Inquiry Routines</h2>

<p>The current setting of each attribute can be determined with an
inquiry routine, e.g., <a href="subroutines.html#PGQCH">PGQCH</a>
to determine the current character height. A general-purpose
subroutine that needs to change attributes temporarily should first
determine the current settings and then restore them before
finishing, e.g.,</p>

<pre class="f">
INTEGER LW, CI
REAL X(7), Y(7)
* <i>save the current attributes</i>
CALL PGQLW(LW)
CALL PGQCI(CI)
* <i>change the attributes and draw something</i>
CALL PGSLW(2)
CALL PGSCI(11)
CALL PGLINE(7, X, Y)
* <i>restore the attributes</i>
CALL PGSLW(LW)
CALL PGSCI(CI)
RETURN
</pre>

<pre class="c">
int lw, ci;
float x[7], y[7];
cpgqlw(&amp;lw);
cpgqci(&amp;ci);
cpgslw(2);
cpgsci(11);
cpgline(7, x, y);
cpgslw(lw);
cpgsci(ci);
return;
</pre>

<p>There are also inquiry routines for determining the current
window (<a href="subroutines.html#PGQWIN">PGQWIN</a>), current
viewport (<a href="subroutines.html#PGQVP">PGQVP</a>), and current
pen position for use with <a href="subroutines.html#PGMOVE">
PGMOVE</a> and <a href="subroutines.html#PGDRAW">PGDRAW</a> (<a
href="subroutines.html#PGQPOS">PGQPOS</a>).</p>

<h2>Saving and Restoring Attributes</h2>

<p>It is sometimes convenient to change the current attributes
temporarily, to draw a small prt of a picture, for example, and
then restore them to their previous settings. This can be
accomplished with the routines <a href="subroutines.html#PGSAVE">
PGSAVE</a> and <a href="subroutines.html#PGUNSA">PGUNSA</a>.</p>

<p><a href="subroutines.html#PGSAVE">PGSAVE</a> saves the current
PGPLOT attributes in a private storage area. They can be restored
by calling <a href="subroutines.html#PGUNSA">PGUNSA</a> (unsave).
Attributes saved are: character font, character height, color
index, fill-area style, line style, line width, pen position,
arrow-head style, hatching style. Color representation is not
saved.</p>

<p>Calls to PGSAVE and PGUNSA should always be paired. Up to 20
copies of the attributes may be saved. PGUNSA always retrieves the
last-saved values (last-in first-out stack).</p>

<p>Note that when multiple devices are in use, PGUNSA retrieves the
values saved by the last PGSAVE call, even if they were for a
different device.</p>

<p>The example in the previous section can be written more simply
as:</p>

<pre class="f">
REAL X(7), Y(7)
* <i>save the current attributes</i>
CALL PGSAVE
* <i>change the attributes and draw something</i>
