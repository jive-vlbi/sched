<H2>LaTeX Picture Environment</H2>

<DL>
<DT><B>Supported device</B>
<DD>
  This driver creates a text file containing commands for drawing
  in the LaTeX picture environment, bracketted by \begin{picture} 
  and \end{picture}. The file can be included in a LaTeX document.<P>

  If you have the option of including a PostScript file in your
  LaTeX document, then that will usually give much better results
  than using this driver, which has very limited capabilities.<P>

<DT><B>Device type code</B>
<DD>
  <code>/LATEX</code><P>

<DT><B>Default file name</B>
<DD>
  <code>pgplot.tex</code><P>

<DT><B>Default view surface dimensions</B>
<DD>
  The default picture size is 6 inches by 6 inches (which corresponds 
  to 1728×1728 units where a unit is 0.25pt = 1/288 inch). The picture
  size can be changed by using PGPAP in the PGPLOT program.<P>

<DT><B>Resolution</B>
<DD>
  The driver rounds coordinates to multiples of 0.25pt (1/288 inch).</P>

<DT><B>Color capability</B>
<DD> 
  None.<P>

<DT><B>Obtaining hardcopy</B>
<DD>Embed the file in a LaTeX document and use the normal LaTeX tools to process it, e.g.,
<PRE>
\documentstyle{article}
\begin{document}
\input pgplot.tex
\end{document}
</PRE>

<DT><B>Limitations</B>
<DD>
  The LaTeX picture environment has a very limited set of primitives.
  In particular, diagonal lines must be composed out of dots. This
  can lead to very large files. For some graphs (especially with a 
  lot of shaded areas), the capacity of many LaTeX systems can easily
  be exceeded.<P>
