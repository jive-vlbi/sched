<h1>Windows and Viewports</h1>

<p>This chapter is concerned with positioning a graph on the screen
or hardcopy page, and controlling its scale. In simple
applications, the position and scale of the graph are controlled
more-or-less automatically by the routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGENV">PGENV</a>, but in order to obtain complete
control of positioning and scaling, it is necessary to understand
the concepts of the <i>View Surface</i>, the <i>Window</i>, and the
<i>Viewport</i>, and two coordinate systems: <i>World
Coordinates</i> and <i>Device Coordinates</i>.</p>

<p>A simple PGPLOT picture might be a two-dimensional graph showing
the dependence of one variable on another. A typical graph has data
points, represented by error bars or special markers such as dots
or diamonds, possibly connected by lines, or perhaps plotted on the
same scale as a theoretical model drawn as a smooth curve. The
graph must be labeled with two axes to indicate the coordinate
scales.</p>

<p>The programmer must describe to PGPLOT the various elements of
the graph in terms of rectangular Cartesian coordinates. The only
limitation on the coordinates is that they be represented as
floating-point (Fortran <code>REAL</code> or <code>REAL*4</code>,
or C <code>float</code>) numbers; otherwise we are totally free to
choose the meaning of the coordinates. For example, in a graph
showing the temporal variation of a quasar, the abscissa
(<i>x</i>-coordinate) might be Epoch (in years) and the ordinate
(<i>y</i>-coordinate) Flux Density (in Jy).</p>

<p>In accordance with common practice in graphics programming,
these coordinates, chosen by the programmer, are termed <i>world
coordinates</i>. PGPLOT maps a selected rectangular region of the
world-coordinate space (termed the <i>window</i>) onto a specified
rectangle (termed the <i>viewport</i>) on the <i>view surface</i>
(the screen of an interactive display or a sheet of paper on a
hardcopy plotter). The program must make calls to PGPLOT routines
to define both the window and the viewport. For complete
descriptions of the routines and their arguments, refer to the
<a href="subroutines.html">subroutine synopses</a>.</p>

<p>After it has opened a graphics device by calling <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGOPEN">PGOPEN</a>, a program has access to a <i>
view surface</i>. This is, for example, a window on the workstation
screen, or a piece of paper on a printer. The size of the view
surface depends on the device. Each device type has a default size,
but on some devices the size can be changed by calling <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGPAP">PGPAP</a> after opening the device, and
some workstations allow the user to change the size of a PGPLOT
window by using the functions of the window manager. A program can
determine the size of the view surface by calling <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGQVSZ">PGQVSZ</a>.</p>

<p>Note that when the graphics device is subdivided into <i>
panels</i>, as described in the preceding chapter, the view surface
is the current panel.</p>

<h2>Defining the Viewport</h2>

<p>A <i>viewport</i> is a rectangular portion of the plotting
surface onto which the graph is mapped. PGPLOT has a default
viewport which is centered on the plotting surface and leaves
sufficient space around it for annotation. The application program
can redefine the viewport by calling routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSVP">PGSVP</a> or <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGVSIZ">PGVSIZ</a>, or reset the default by
calling <a href="subroutines.html#PGVSTD">PGVSTD</a>.</p>

<p><a href="subroutines.html#PGSVP">PGSVP</a> defines the viewport
in a device-independent manner, using a coordinate system whose
coordinates run from 0 to 1 in both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. This
coordinate system is called <i>normalized device coordinate
space</i>. For example, if we wish to divide the view surface into
four quadrants and map a different plot onto each quadrant, we can
define a new viewport before starting each plot. PGSVP has the
format:</p>

<pre class="f">
CALL PGSVP(XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, YMAX)
</pre>

<pre class="c">
cpgsvp(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax);
</pre>

For example, to map the viewport onto the upper left quadrant of
the view surface: 

<pre class="f">
CALL PGSVP(0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0)
</pre>

<pre class="c">
cpgsvp(0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0);
</pre>

<p>(Note that this does not leave room around the edge of the viewport
for annotation.)</p>

<p><a href="subroutines.html#PGVSIZ">PGVSIZ</a> defines the
viewport in absolute coordinates (inches); it should only be used
when it is known how big the view surface is and a definite plot
scale is required. The arguments are the same as for PGSVP, but
measured in inches from the bottom left corner of the view surface
(1 inch = 25.4 mm). For example:</p>

<pre class="f">CALL PGVSIZ(1.5, 9.5, 1.5, 6.5)
</pre>

<pre class="c">cpgvsiz(1.5, 9.5, 1.5, 6.5);
</pre>

<p>defines a rectangular viewport 8 by 5 inches, offset 1.5 inches
from the bottom and left edges of the view surface.</p>
 
<p><a href="subroutines.html#PGVSTD">PGVSTD</a> defines a standard
viewport, the size of which depends on the particular device being
used, and on the current character size (it uses the whole view
surface excluding a margin of four character heights all
around):</p>

<pre class="f">CALL PGVSTD</pre>

<pre class="c">cpgvstd();</pre>

<p>This is the default viewport set up by PGOPEN.</p>

<p>Note that the viewport must be defined <i>before</i> calling any
routines that would actually generate a display. The viewport may,
however, be changed at any time: this will affect the appearance of
objects drawn later in the program.</p>

<h2>Defining the Window</h2>

<p>The program defines the <i>window</i> by calling routine <a
href="subroutines.html#PGSWIN">PGSWIN</a>, whose arguments specify
the world-coordinate limits of the window along each coordinate
axis, e.g.</p>

<pre class="f">CALL PGSWIN(1975.0, 1984.0, 5.0, 20.0)
</pre>

<pre class="c">cpgswin(1975.0, 1984.0, 5.0, 20.0);
</pre>

<p>specifies that the <i>x</i>-axis (epoch) is going to run (left to
right) from 1975 to 1984, and the <i>y</i>-axis (flux density) is
going to run (bottom to top) from 5 to 20~Jy. Note that the
arguments are floating-point numbers (Fortran <code>REAL</code> or
C <code>float</code> variables or constants), and require decimal
points. If the order of either the <i>x</i> pair or the <i>y</i>
pair is reversed, the corresponding axis will point in the opposite
sense, i.e., right to left for <i>x</i> or top to bottom for <i>
y</i>. PGPLOT uses the window specification to construct a mapping
that causes the image of the window to coincide with the viewport
on the view surface. Furthermore, PGPLOT ``clips'' lines so that
only those portions of objects that lie within the window are
displayed on the view surface.</p>

<p>Like the viewport, the window must be defined before drawing any
objects. The window can be defined either before or after the
viewport: the effect will be the same. The default window, set up
by PGOPEN, has <i>x</i> limits 0.0 - 1.0 and <i>y</i> limits 0.0 -
1.0.</p>

<p>If the ratio of the sides of the window does not equal the ratio
of the sides of the viewport, the mapping of the world coordinates
onto the view surface results in an image whose shape is compressed
in either <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>. One way to avoid this compression
is to carefully choose the viewport to have the same aspect ratio
as the window. Routine <a href="subroutines.html#PGWNAD">PGWNAD</a>
can do this: it defines the window and simultaneously adjusts the
viewport to have the same aspect ratio as the window. The new
viewport is the largest that can fit inside the old one, and is
centered in the old one.</p>

<h2>Annotating the Viewport</h2>

<p>For a simple graph, it is usually necessary to draw a frame
around the viewport and label the frame with tick marks and numeric
labels. This can be done with the routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGBOX">PGBOX</a>. For our sample graph, the call
might be:</p>

<pre class="f">CALL PGBOX('BCTN', 0.0, 0, 'BCNST', 0.0, 0)
</pre>

<pre class="c">cpgbox("BCTN", 0.0, 0, "BCNST", 0.0, 0);
</pre>

<p>PGBOX has many options for controlling the appearance of the box or
graph axes, and there is another routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGAXIS">PGAXIS</a> which provides further
capabilities (see <a href="chapter6.html">Chapter 8</a>).</p>

<p>Another routine, <a href="subroutines.html#PGLAB">PGLAB</a>,
provides text labels for the bottom, left hand side, and top of the
viewport:</p>

<pre class="f">CALL PGLAB('Epoch', 'Flux Density (Jy)',
           'Variation of 3C345 at 10.7 GHz')
</pre>

<pre class="c">cpglab("Epoch", "Flux Density (Jy)",
       "Variation of 3C345 at 10.7 GHz");
</pre>

<p>The first two arguments provide explanations for the two axes; the
third provides a title for the whole plot. Note that unlike all the
other plotting routines, the lines and characters drawn by PGBOX
and PGLAB are not clipped at the boundaries of the window. PGLAB
actually calls a more general routine, <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGMTXT">PGMTXT</a>, which can be used for
plotting labels at any point relative to the viewport.</p>

<p>The amount of space needed outside the viewport for annotation
depends on the exact options specified in PGBOX; usually four
character heights will be sufficient, and this is the amount
allowed when the standard viewport (created by PGVSTD) is used. The
character height can be changed by using routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGSCH">PGSCH</a> (see <a href="attributes.html">
Chapter 7</a>).</p>

<h2>Routine PGENV</h2>

<p>Having to specify calls to PGPAGE, PGSVP, PGSWIN, and PGBOX is
excessively cumbersome for drawing simple graphs. Routine <a href=
"subroutines.html#PGENV">PGENV</a> (for PGplot ENVironment)
combines all four of these in one subroutine, using the standard
viewport, and a limited set of the capabilities of PGBOX. For
example, the graph described above could be initiated by the
following call:</p>

<pre class="f">CALL PGENV(1975.0, 1984.0, 5.0, 20.0, 0, 0)
</pre>

<pre class="c">cpgenv(1975.0, 1984.0, 5.0, 20.0, 0, 0);
</pre>

<p>which is equivalent to the following series of calls: </p>

<pre class="f">CALL PGPAGE
CALL PGVSTD
CALL PGSWIN(1975.0, 1984.0, 5.0, 20.0)
CALL PGBOX('BCNST', 0.0, 0, 'BCNST', 0.0, 0)
</pre>

<pre class="c">cpgpage();
cpgvstd();
cpgswin(1975.0, 1984.0, 5.0, 20.0);
cpgbox("BCNST", 0.0, 0, "BCNST", 0.0, 0);
</pre>

<p>PGENV uses the standard viewport. The first four arguments define
the world-coordinate limits of the window. The fifth argument can
be 0 or 1; if it is 1, PGENV calls PGWNAD instead of PGSWIN so that
the plot has equal scales in <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. The sixth
argument controls the amount of annotation.</p>
