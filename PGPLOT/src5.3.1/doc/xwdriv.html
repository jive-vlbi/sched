<H2>X Window Workstations</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>Author</B>
<DD>M. C. Shepherd, 1994.

<P>
<DT><b>Supported device</b>
<DD>All workstations running the X Window System (Version 11 Release 4
         and above) under
UNIX, VMS and OpenVMS.

<P>
<DT><b>Device type codes</b>
<DD>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>/XWINDOW</CODE> opens a window that disappears when PGEND is called.
<LI><CODE>/XSERVE</CODE> opens a window that persists for reuse after
    PGEND is called.
</UL>

<BR>
<DT><b>Default device name</b>
<DD>The default X display name defined by one's environment.
    <BR> Under UNIX this is given by the <CODE>DISPLAY</CODE>
         environment variable.
    <BR> Under VMS it is the device last created with
         <CODE>CREATE/DISPLAY</CODE>. 

<P>
<DT><b>Device name specification</b>
<DD><CODE>window@host:display.screen</CODE>
   <P>
   The device name specifies the X-window display to use,
   the screen of that display and the PGPLOT window number to use.
   <P>
   The <CODE>window</CODE> number is a small integer used to identify
   individual windows created by PGPLOT. You can either specify the
   number of an existing inactive window to reuse, or provide a new
   number to assign to a new window. If the number is omitted or
   specified as zero, then either the last window to become inactive will
   be reused, or a new window will be created and assigned the lowest
   unused window number. The number of each window is displayed in the
   title of the window.
   <P>
   The <CODE>host</CODE> part of the specification is the address of
   the host on which the display resides. If a DECNET address is used,
   the host name should be separated from the display number by two
   colons instead of one.
   <P>
   The <CODE>display</CODE> part of the specification is the number of the
   display server on the given host. Usually this is 0, but if you
   have multiple X terminals connected to the same machine, then each
   terminal is generally assigned a different display number.
   <P>
   The <CODE>screen</CODE> number is also usually 0, but if your display has
   multiple screens, then each is identified by a small integer.
   <P>
   For example &quot;<CODE>2@foo.wherever.edu:0.0/xw</CODE>&quot; opens
   PGPLOT window 2 as a <CODE>/xwindow</CODE> window on host
   <CODE>foo.wherever.edu</CODE>. Note that the @ symbol is optional
   if the display name is omitted. Thus &quot;<CODE>2/xw</CODE>&quot;
   opens window 2 on the default display.
   <P>

<DT><b>Default view surface dimensions</b>
<DD>The default geometry of each window is specified in pixels, using
    the following hierarchy of specifications. Missing details at each
    level are supplied by those below.
<OL>
<LI>X resource:    <CODE>pgxwin.win#.geometry:    WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y</CODE>
<LI>X resource:    <CODE>pgxwin.Win.geometry:    WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y</CODE>
<LI>Environment variable: <CODE>PGPLOT_XW_WIDTH</CODE>  [fractional display width]
<LI>Width=867, height=669 and aspect=8.5/11.
</OL>
    Once displayed, the window can be resized with the mouse, but the
    drawing area is only resized to reflect this when the next page is
    started.

<P>
<DT><b>Resolution</b>
<DD>Depends on monitor.

<P>
<DT><b>Color capability</b>
<DD>Colormaps of types PseudoColor, StaticColor, GrayScale,
    StaticGray, and TrueColor are supported. By default, the first
    available colormap from one of the following lists is used.

    <UL>
    <LI> For color displays: PseudoColor, StaticColor, TrueColor.
    <LI> For gray-scale displays: GrayScale, StaticGray.
    <LI> For monochrome displays: The default colormap of the screen.
    </UL>

    Thus, where possible a read/write colormap is chosen. This allows
    color representation changes via PGCTAB, PGSCR and PGSHLS to
    be applied immediately to previously drawn graphics, which makes
    it possible to interactively fiddle the colors when used in
    conjunction with PGBAND.
    <P>
    If the first available colormap type happens to match that of the
    default colormap of the screen, and enough colors are available
    therein, then that colormap is used. Otherwise, allocation of a
    private colormap is attempted. If this fails, the device is
    treated as monochrome. The default color-map type can be overriden
    via the <CODE>pgxwin.Win.visual</CODE> resource described below.
    However, if the requested colormap type is not available, the
    driver reverts to its default colormap search strategy.
    <P>
    When allocating colors from the colormap that other applications
    on the display are also using, if that colormap is of a type where
    applications compete for a limited number of modifiable color
    cells, rather than sharing a predefined table of colors, the
    driver tries to allocate 100 colors. This number usually makes it
    possible to have two windows displayed simultaneously without
    having to allocate a private colormap. This helps to avoid
    colormap flashing as the pointer is moved between windows. You can
    override this default with a number in the range 2 to 255 by using
    the <CODE>pgxwin.Win.maxColors</CODE> X resource.

<P>
<DT><b>Input capability</b>
<DD>The cursor is usually controlled by a mouse. Cursor input is
    achieved by moving the cursor into the window, and pressing either
    a mouse button or a keyboard key to select a given position in the
    window and return a key value. The mouse buttons are mapped to
    return characters A, D, and X.  The cursor can also be moved horizontally
    and vertically with the keyboard arrow keys: each keystroke moves the
    cursor by one pixel, or 10 pixels if the SHIFT key is depressed.
    Rubber-banding is supported: see
    routine PGBAND. With <em>Click-to-focus</em> window managers you
    may have to explicitly click on the window to enable keyboard
    input in the PGPLOT window.

<P>
<DT><b>X resources</b>
<DD>The following optional X window resources can be used to specify
    configuration options. On POSIX-compliant systems, these should
    be placed in a file called <CODE>.Xdefaults</CODE> in your home
    directory. Under VMS they should be placed in
    <CODE>DECW$USER_DEFAULTS:DECW$XDEFAULTS.DAT</CODE>. Note that by
    default DECW$USER_DEFAULTS is defined as SYS$LOGIN. Resource
    specification is discussed further in the &quot;<tt>Potential
    problems</tt>&quot; section further below.
    <P>
    The following resource descriptions show how a resource line
    should be constructed in one's resource file. Where default values
    are available they are indicated. Otherwise the value is indicated
    symbolically and instructions are given for substituting
    appropriate values.
   <DL>

   <DT><CODE>pgxwin.Win.geometry:     WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y</CODE>
   <DD>This specifies the size and position of a window in pixels.
       Any of the above components can be omitted. The X and Y values
       specify the position of the top left corner of the window wrt
       the top left corner of the screen, if positive, or the bottom
       right corner wrt the bottom right corner, if negative.

   <P>
   <DT><CODE>pgxwin.Win.iconGeometry:     +X+Y</CODE>
   <DD>This specifies the position of the iconized form of a window,
       in pixels. The X and Y values specify the position of the top
       left corner of the window wrt the top left corner of the
       screen, if positive, or the bottom right corner wrt the bottom
       right corner, if negative.

   <P>
   <DT><CODE>pgxwin.Win.acceptQuit:   False</CODE>
   <DD>Most window managers provide a way for the user to destroy a
       window using the mouse, often via an option in a pull down
       menu.  By default PGPLOT takes steps to ignore this action when
       a window is actually being used by a PGPLOT program. To
       re-enable it, set:<BR> <CODE>pgxwin.Win.acceptQuit: True</CODE>

   <P>
   <DT><CODE>pgxwin.Win.iconize:     False</CODE>
   <DD>By default, PGPLOT /XSERVE windows remain mapped when PGEND is
       called or when the program is terminated.  If instead you wish
       the window to be iconized until opened by a new PGPLOT program,
       set:
       <BR> <CODE>pgxwin.Win.iconize: True</CODE>

   <P>
   <DT><CODE>pgxwin.Win.maxColors:   100</CODE>
   <DD>When allocating colors from the colormap that other
       applications on the display are also using, if that colormap is
       of a type where applications compete for a limited number of
       modifiable color cells, as opposed to a predefined table of
       colors that all applications share, the
       <CODE>pgxwin.Win.maxColors</CODE> specifies the maximum number
       of colors that the driver attempts to allocate for each pgplot
       window. The smaller the number chosen, the grater the number of
       PGPLOT windows that can be displayed simultaneously without
       causing "colormap flashing".

       When allocating private colormaps, and when allocating colors
       from readonly colormaps that are shared with other
       applications, the driver attempts to allocate the PGPLOT
       maximum of 256 colors, regardless of the value of the
       <CODE>pgxwin.Win.maxColors</CODE> resource. However, when
       searching for a suitable private colormap, if multiple
       colormaps of different sizes are available, the driver uses
       this resource as a hint as to which of these colormap to
       choose. If possible, it allocates a colormap of &gt;= maxColors
       colors, and if there is more than one colormap that satifies
       this constraint, the smallest is selected.

   <P>
   <DT><CODE>pgxwin.Win.minColors:   16</CODE>
   <DD>To reject colormaps with fewer than a given number of color
       entries, specify the minimum number of colors required.

   <P>
   <DT><CODE>pgxwin.Win.visual:      default</CODE>
   <DD>If you have a preference for the type of colormap to use,
       specify the name of the preferred type. PGPLOT will then try
       that type first. The following type names are recognized:
	<UL>
	<LI>default     -  Use the colormap search strategy described
    in the &quot;<tt>Color Capability</tt>&quot; section.
        <LI>monochrome  -  Use black and white.
        <LI>PseudoColor -  Read/write color visual.
        <LI>DirectColor -  (This is treated as an alias for TrueColor).
        <LI>StaticColor -  Read-only color visual.
        <LI>TrueColor   -  Read-only color visual (3 primary colortables).
        <LI>GrayScale   -  Read/write gray-scale visual.
        <LI>StaticGray  -  Read-only gray-scale visual.
	</UL>

   <BR>
   <DT><CODE>pgxwin.Win.crosshair:   False</CODE>
   <DD>To augment the default active PGPLOT cursor with cross hairs,
       set:
      <BR><CODE>pgxwin.Win.crosshair: True</CODE>

   <P>
   <DT><CODE>pgxwin.server.visible:     True</CODE>
   <DD>To hide the PGPLOT server window set
       <BR><CODE>pgxwin.server.visible: False</CODE>

   <P>
   <DT><CODE>pgxwin.server.iconGeometry:     +X+Y</CODE>
   <DD>This specifies the position of the server window icon on the X
       display, in display pixels. The X and Y values specify the
       position of the top left corner of the window wrt the top left
       corner of the screen, if positive, or the bottom right corner
       wrt the bottom right corner, if negative.
   </DL>

   Note that resource specifications that start with
   <tt>pgxwin.Win</tt> apply to all PGPLOT /xwindow and /xserve
   windows. To target options at specific windows, replace the
   <tt>Win</tt> component of the specification with <tt>win#</tt>,
   where <tt>#</tt> is the number of the PGPLOT window. For
   example:<br>

   <pre>
   pgxwin.Win.crosshair:       True
   pgxwin.win2.crosshair:      False
   </pre>

   stipulates that all windows except PGPLOT window 2 will use a
   crosshair for the default cursor. Note that <tt>Win</tt> is spelt
   with an upper case initial <tt>'W'</tt>, whereas <tt>win#</tt> is
   spelt with an initial lower-case <tt>'w'</tt>. This is important
   because all resource names are case sensitive.
   <P>
   A better example of the utility of targeting options at specific
   windows is the following:

   <pre>
   pgxwin.Win.geometry:        500x500+600+360
   pgxwin.win1.geometry:       500x500+600+33
   </pre>

   This example places the first PGPLOT window in one position on the
   display, and all other windows in a second location - thus avoiding
   obscuring the first by the second etc..
   <P>
   Similarly if one wanted to dedicate one window to line graphics,
   one could designate a specific window number to have a reduced
   number of colors.

   <pre>
   pgxwin.win10.maxColors:     16
   </pre>

   This window would then be selected using a device specification of
   &quot;<tt>10/xserve</tt>&quot;.
   <P>

<DT><b>The /XWINDOW and /XSERVE window server (pgxwin_server).</b>
<DD>All PGPLOT /xwindow and /xserve windows on a single display are
created and maintained by a separate server program called
pgxwin_server. If PGPLOT has been installed correctly then this
program is automatically started by the /xw and /xs driver when first
called upon. pgxwin_server then continues to serve windows to
subsequent PGPLOT programs and remains running indefinitely. In order
that it be possible to kill the server, an icon window for it is
displayed. Window managers generally provide a way to interactively
kill windows, and if this is applied to the server window, then the
server will close any inactive /xserve windows, and if no active /xw
or /xs windows remain, then the server will shut itself down cleanly.
Note that inactive windows are distinguishable from active windows by
the appearance of a skull-and-crossbones cursor.
<P>
If pgxwin_server fails to start automatically, see the
&quot;<tt>Potential problems</tt>&quot; section below on how to remedy
this. However, if for some reason it is necessary to run pgxwin_server 
manually, you'll need to know the following. In particular, under VMS,
before you can run the server you will first need to register it as a
foreign command, by typing:

<PRE>
pgxwin_server:=="$directory_name:pgxwin_server.exe"
</PRE>

If your default display is correctly set then simply typing:

<PRE>
pgxwin_server
</PRE>

with no arguments should start the server, and the server icon should
appear on the display. If an alternate display is desired then the
default display can be overridden with the -display argument. Other
options to override selected X resources from the command-line are
also available. To see them type:

<PRE>
pgxwin_server -help
</PRE>
<P>
<DT><b>Potential problems.</b>
  <DD><DL>
  <DT>The server fails to start.
  <DD>If the server fails to start automatically then this means that
      the /xw and /xs driver was unable to find the pgxwin_server
      executable. It first looks in the directory specified in your
      PGPLOT_DIR environment variable (or LOGICAL PGPLOT_DIR variable
      under VMS). Under UNIX, if it fails to find the executable
      there, it then looks for the executable in each component
      directory cited in your PATH environment variable. To fix the
      problem, first determine where the person who compiled PGPLOT
      installed pgxwin_server and then either place this directory
      name in your PGPLOT_DIR variable or, under UNIX, add it to your
      PATH.
      <P>
      If you are still unable to get the server to start automatically,
      please send me Email at mcs@astro.caltech.edu. In the meantime,
      you can work around the problem by starting the server by hand,
      as described previously.
  <P>
  <DT>X resource options are ignored.
  <DD>
      First check check both the spelling and case of your resource
      names. Resource names are case sensitive and must appear
      <em>exactly</em> as indicated above.
      <P>      
      The X resource database is compiled by the pgxwin_server program
      when it is started. Resources set after it has been started are
      ignored and pgxwin_server will need to be restarted before they
      are acquired. There are a number of places in which the server
      can find resources, and your specifications will not be seen if
      they appear in the wrong place. pgxwin_server attempts to follow
      the rules laid down by the X Toolkit. First it looks for a
      RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of your display.
      This contains a list of resource names and values and comes into
      being when the standard xrdb program is applied to a resource
      file. It is common for xrdb to be applied automatically to your
      Xdefaults file, or to a system supplied xdefaults file when the
      X server is first started. If this is the case then changes to
      your Xdefaults file will be ignored until the server is
      restarted or you explicitly re-run the xrdb command.
      <P>
      If - and only if - the RESOURCE_MANAGER property does not exist,
      then under UNIX pgxwin_server looks for a file called .Xdefaults
      in your home directory, and under VMS it looks for a file called
      DECW$USER_DEFAULTS:DECW$XDEFAULTS.DAT. If it finds this file, it
      initializes its resource database from it. It then also looks to
      see if the XENVIRONMENT environment variable contains a valid
      file name and if so reads resources from that file, overriding
      any contrasting resources from your Xdefaults file.
      <P>
      To be sure that changes to resources in your Xdefaults are seen
      by pgxwin_server you should use the xrdb command to install them
      on the display:
      <P>
      <DL>
      <DT>UNIX:
      <DD> <PRE> (cd;xrdb .Xdefaults) </PRE>
      <P>
      <DT>VMS:
      <DD> <PRE> $ xrdb -nocpp decw$user_defaults:decw$xdefaults.dat</PRE>
           If the xrdb command is not defined on your system, then first
            execute:
           <PRE> $ @DECW$UTILS:DECW$DEFINE_UTILS.COM </PRE>
      </DL>
      <P>
      Then terminate pgxwin_server by quiting its icon and ask for /xw
      or /xs again to restart it.
  </DL>
