<h1>Porting PGPLOT</h1>

<p>This chapter gives some hints for people trying to install PGPLOT
on a computer running an unsupported operating system.</p>

<h2>General Notes</h2>

<p>The PGPLOT library consists of the following routines:</p>

<ol>
<li>The &ldquo;standard&rdquo; routines <code>pgplot/src/pg*.f</code> and
<code>pgplot/src/gr*.f</code>. All of these routines should be
compiled and put in the object-module library, although the
&ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; routines may be omitted (they are not used by
current PGPLOT programs and will not be included in future versions of
PGPLOT). The obsolete routines are: <code>grchar, grchr0, grdat2,
grgtc0, grinqfont, grinqli, grinqpen, grlinr, grmark, grmovr,
grsetfont, grsetli, grsetpen, grtran, grvect, pgsetc,
pgsize</code>. All routines in the pgplot/src directory are standard
Fortran-77 with the following exceptions:

<ul>
<li>Several routines use the non-standard INCLUDE statement; if
your compiler does not accept this, you need to replace the INCLUDE
statement with the contents of the named file
(<code>pgplot.inc</code> or <code>grpckg1.inc</code> as
appropriate).</li>

<li>Some routines have names longer than 6 characters, the maximum
allowed by the Fortran-77 standard: these routines can be omitted:
all have shorter aliases that can be used in preference (e.g.,
PGPAGE instead of PGADVANCE).</li>

<li>One routine, GRSYXD, uses a non-standard INTEGER*2 statement;
you can replace this with INTEGER, but if you do so you must make
the corresponding change in GRSY00 and PGPACK (see below).</li>

<li>Routine GRCLPL uses function IAND(I,J) for bitwise logical and
of two integers; most compilers recognize this as an intrinsic
function and compile it inline, but if yours does not, you will
need to supply this as an external function.</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>The system-dependent routines. Versions of these routines that
work for many UNIX systems are provided in directory <code>
pgplot/sys</code>, but for other systems these will need to be
written. Some of the routines are used only by certain device
drivers and will not be needed if you do not use these drivers. 

<ul>
<li>GRDATE -- get date and time as character string</li>

<li>GRFILEIO -- routines GROFIL, GRCFIL, GRWFIL, GRWFCH for binary
file I/O</li>

<li>GRFLUN -- free a Fortran logical unit number</li>

<li>GRFMEM -- free memory</li>

<li>GRGCOM -- read with prompt from user's terminal</li>

<li>GRGENV -- get value of PGPLOT environment parameter</li>

<li>GRGLUN -- get a Fortran logical unit number</li>

<li>GRGMEM -- allocate memory</li>

<li>GRGMSG -- print system message</li>

<li>GRIBF1 -- fill buffer with a specified character</li>

<li>GROPTX -- open input/output text file</li>

<li>GRSY00 -- initialize font definition</li>

<li>GRTERMIO -- routines GROTER, GRCTER, GRWTER, GRPTER, GRRTER for
I/O to terminals</li>

<li>GRTRML -- get name of user's terminal</li>

<li>GRTTER -- test whether device is user's terminal</li>

<li>GRUSER -- get user name</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>The device-dispatch routine, <code>grexec.f</code>. This
routine includes calls to all the selected device drivers. It is
the only routine that needs to be modified to configure PGPLOT for
a particular installation. It is usally generated automatically
from <code>drivers.list</code>. For more information about this
routine, see <a href="drivers.html">Writing a PGPLOT Device Handler</a>.
</li>

<li>The device drivers. Most device drivers are included in single
files in the <code>pgplot/drivers</code> directory, with file name
<code>XXdriv.f</code> or <code>XXdriv.c</code>. Some C drivers
require additional <code>.c</code> or <code>.h</code> files. The
drivers you wish to include in PGPLOT should be compiled and added
to the object library. Many of the device drivers are written in
portable, standard Fortran-77, but others cannot be written
portably and either use Fortran-77 with extensions (such as <code>
BYTE</code> and <code>%VAL</code>) or C. Some of the older drivers
are sloppily written and could be made more portable. For driver
written in C, it is necessary to pay careful attention to the
system-dependent conventions for calling C subroutines from Fortran
programs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Porting to UNIX systems</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>While no two UNIX systems are identical, the overall similarities
allow for a single installation procedure. The procedure, embodied
in pgplot/makemake, is implemented as a Bourne shell script whose
job is to create makefiles specific to specific systems. The design
goals of the script were:</p>

<ol>
<li>To provide a uniform installation procedure for as many systems
as possible.</li>

<li>To support PGPLOT compilation in directories other than the
distribution directory. If the disk containing the source code
distribution is cross-mounted over a number of different UNIX
systems, this allows one copy of the source code to be used to
compile PGPLOT on each of those systems. It also allows the
source-code directory to be placed on a read-only disk partition or
CD-ROM.</li>

<li>To allow more than one compiler combination on systems that
support multiple compilers. Separate configuration files are
provided for each compiler combination.</li>

<li>To avoid code duplication of system-specific routines where
possible. The script allows one to selectively override generic
routines with system specific versions.</li>

<li>To make the script behave as told by the user, rather than have
it try to automatically determine its configuration from the system
that it is run upon. This enables one to make makefiles for many
systems without actually having to log in to those systems.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to port PGPLOT to a new UNIX system</h3>

<h4>Create a system directory</h4>

<p>The first thing to do when porting to a new system is to create a
system directory for the port. This is where system-specific
source-code and system attributes, will be placed. If the generic
name for your system is say xxx, then the system directory must be
called pgplot/sys_xxx. The xxx suffix is the name used by users to
to specify a system type to the makemake script.</p>

<h4>Create a configuration file</h4>

<p>The next thing to do is to create a configuration file within the
new system directory. This is a Bourne shell script containing
assignments to the shell variables that determine how makemake will
configure a makefile for your system.</p>

<p>Configuration files are distinguished from other files by a
.conf file name extension. If you intend to support more than one
FORTRAN and/or C compiler, then one configuration file will be
needed per compiler combination. By convention, configuration files
are named as a_b.conf, where <code>a</code> is the name of the
FORTRAN compiler and <code>b</code> is the name of the C
compiler.</p>

<p>The first line must be a short Bourne shell comment that
describes how the configuration differs from other configuration
files in the system directory. In most configuration files, the
comment just ellaborates on which FORTRAN and C compilers are being
configured. The comment is displayed alongside the configuration
name when makemake users fail to specify a configuration name.</p>

<p>The easiest way to create a new configuration file is to copy
one from another sys_xxx directory, rename it and then modify the
shell variable assignments to suite your system. Note that within
these scripts no spaces are tolerated around the = operator, and
that you should enclose the assignment string within double
quotes.</p>


<h4>Configuration file variables</h4>

<p>Some of the supported variables are obligatory, while others are
optional. The required variables and their meanings are:</p>

<dl>
<dt>XINCL</dt>

<dd>The argument used to tell the C compiler where the X11/ include
directory can be found. If your machine doesn't have X-windows,
assign the empty string "". e.g., 

<pre>
      XINCL=""
      XINCL="-I/usr/local/include"
      XINCL="-I/usr/openwin/include"
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>FCOMPL</dt>

<dd>The command used to invoke the FORTRAN compiler. e.g., 

<pre>
      FCOMPL="f77"
      FCOMPL="fort77"
      FCOMPL="fortran"
      FCOMPL="frt"
      FCOMPL="gf77"
      FCOMPL="xlf"
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>FFLAGC</dt>

<dd>Any FORTRAN compiler flags required for compiling and linking
the PGPLOT library. Note that this should not include the "-c" or
"-o" options, which are automatically added, where needed, by the
makemake script. Examples of possible flags to include, are
optimization level flags and flags pertinent to creating shared
libraries (where possible). This is usually an option to generate
position-independent code (e.g., "+z", "-fpic", "-K PIC"). An
option to check for undeclared variables (e.g., "-u") may be
specified, but is not required. An option to use static rather than
automatic storage (e.g., "-static") is not required but may be
used: PGPLOT should work correctly with either static or automatic
storage. e.g., 

<pre>
      FFLAGC="-u -O"
      FFLAGC="-u -PIC -O"
      FFLAGC="-u -pic -O"
      FFLAGC="-u"
      FFLAGC='-Wf"-o novector -i64"'
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>FFLAGD</dt>

<dd>In most cases this should be the same as FFLAGC. It is used
instead of FFLAGC when compiling and linking the PGPLOT demo
programs. The main potential difference has to do with the fact
that many of the demo programs exploit the '\' character to
introduce special plot symbols within PGPLOT text. Unfortunately
many compilers treat this as an escape character. To avoid this,
FFLAGD should include a flag to tell the compiler to turn off
special treatment of this character. Options for shared libraries
(position-independent code) are not required. e.g., 

<pre>
      FFLAGD=""
      FFLAGD="-O0"
      FFLAGD="-assume backslash"
      FFLAGD="-u -!bs"
      FFLAGD="-u -O"
      FFLAGD="-u -backslash -O0"
      FFLAGD="-u -qnoescape"
      FFLAGD="-xl -u -O"
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>CCOMPL</dt>

<dd>The command used to invoke the chosen C compiler on your
system. If you intend to use the C wrapper library <a href=
"cbinding.html"><code>cpgplot</code></a>, then this should be an
ANSI-C compiler. Otherwise a pre-ANSI K&amp;R C compiler will be
sufficient. e.g., 

<pre>
      CCOMPL="/usr/ucb/cc"
      CCOMPL="c89"
      CCOMPL="cc"
      CCOMPL="gcc"
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>CFLAGC</dt>

<dd>Any C compiler flags that are needed to compile PGPLOT. Note
that this should not include the "-c" or "-o" options, which are
automatically added, where needed, by the makemake script. Examples
of possible flags to include, are optimization level flags and
flags pertinent to creating shared libraries (where possible; the
option usually required is the one that generates
"position-independent code"). Also, if your system exports FORTRAN
symbols to the linker postfixed with an underscore then you should
include the -DPG_PPU flag. e.g., 

<pre>
      CFLAGC=""
      CFLAGC="+z -O -D_HPUX_SOURCE"
      CFLAGC="-DPG_PPU -pic -O"
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>LIBS</dt>

<dd>This should specify the loader flags required to cite any
external libraries that are required when linking any of the demo
and server programs. In most cases this is just the X-windows
library, cited as "-Ldirectory_name -lX11" where directory_name is
the name of the directory in which the library resides. e.g., 

<pre>
      LIBS=""
      LIBS="-L/usr/lib/X11R5 -lX11"
      LIBS="-L/usr/openwin/lib -lX11"
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>RANLIB</dt>

<dd>Many older UNIX systems require newly created or modified
libraries to be post-processed for better access speed. On such
systems, you should set RANLIB="ranlib". On other systems you
should set RANLIB="echo ranlib".</dd>
</dl>

The following are optional. If they are not pertinent to your
system configuration, you must omit them from the configuration
script. 

<dl>
<dt>MOTIF_INCLUDE, MOTIF_LIBS</dt>

<dd>On systems where Motif is installed the MOTIF_INCLUDE and
MOTIF_LIBS configuration variables should contain flags telling the
C compiler and loader where to find the include files and libraries
associated with Motif. This should include files related to X11, Xt
and Xm. Note that the XINCL and LIBS variables are not consulted
when compiling and linking Motif code, e.g., 

<pre>
      MOTIF_INCL="-I/usr/dt/include $XINCL"
      MOTIF_LIBS="-L/usr/dt/lib -lXm -L/usr/openwin/lib -lXt $LIBS"
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>SYSDIR</dt>

<dd>On entering the configuration script, this variable contains
the directory name of the system directory in which the
configuration file resides. If you have multiple compiler
combinations which require a different set of system-specific
routines, then you should create a subdirectory in the system
directory, for each combination, and redirect SYSDIR in each
configuration file, to point at the relevant directory. eg.
SYSDIR="$SYSDIR/f77_cc/".</dd>

<dt>PGBIND_FLAGS</dt>

<dd>If you wish to have the PGPLOT C wrapper library compiled for
your system, then you will need to assign this variable. Its
arguments are the configuration flags to the PGPLOT pgbind command.
To see the available options, compile the pgbind program in
pgplot/cpg/ with an ANSI-C compiler and invoke it with no
arguments.</dd>

<dt>SHARED_LIB</dt>

<dd>If your system supports shared libraries, you should specify
the name to give the shared library here.</dd>

<dt>SHARED_LD</dt>

<dd>If your system supports shared libraries, then you should
specify the command and its leading arguments, which when all the
PGPLOT object files are appended as trailing arguments, will create
a shared library. You can use the SHARED_LIB variable specified
above as an argument to this command, by referring to it as
$SHARED_LIB.</dd>

<dt>MCOMPL</dt>

<dd>The command used to invoke the chosen Objective C compiler on
your system. This is only required if any of the system code that
you supply is written in Objective C. Few people have Objective C
compilers, so you should stick to using just C and FORTRAN if at
all possible.</dd>

<dt>MFLAGC</dt>

<dd>The compiler flags to use with MCOMPL. Note that this should
not include the "-c" or "-o" options, which are automatically
added, where needed, by the makemake script.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Creating system-dependent files</h4>

<p>While every effort was made to write PGPLOT in standard FORTRAN-77,
some routines, particularly those that provide interfaces to
terminals and other graphics devices, had to be written using
either FORTRAN extensions or C code. Versions of these routines
that work on many systems are included in the pgplot/sys/
directory. When the makemake script looks for the system dependent
routines, it looks first in the specific pgplot/sys_xxx directory
then in the default pgplot/sys/ directory, so you can override one
or more of the default versions, by placing your own versions in
the new system directory. The new versions can be in C, FORTRAN or,
if unavoidable, Objective C (postfixed with .f, .c or .m
respectively).</p>

<p>Points to consider when determining whether new versions of the
default system routines are required include the following.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>FORTRAN routines</b></dt>

<dd><p>All of the *.f files in pgplot/sys/ use FORTRAN extensions, or
rely upon unportable assumptions such as unformatted I/O record
sizes. If you are not familiar with the specifics of your FORTRAN
compiler, then probably the best thing to do here, is to simply try
to compile PGPLOT without overriding any of the default FORTRAN
code, and see what the compiler or linker chokes upon.</p>

<p>Problems that might only show up at run time include:</p>

<ul>
<li>PGPLOT crashes when trying to read its FONT file. This probably
means that grsy00.f, which relies upon being able to read large
unformatted record sizes, will need to be re-written. This is a
difficult problem to fix. The simplest way is to replace both
pgplot/sys/grsy00.f and pgplot/fonts/pgpack.f with versions that
read and write a useable file format. Both files should be placed
in your local system directory. makemake will pick them up from
there and compile them in place of the default versions.</li>

<li>When PGPLOT prompts for terminal input, the cursor is placed on
the line after the prompt. This is only a cosmetic problem, but if
you can find a way to suppress the carriage return at the end of
the prompt string, the appearance will be better.</li>
</ul>

<p>An optional routine that makemake only compiles if it finds a
version in your system directory, is a replacement for the common
IAND() intrinsic function. This is used by pgplot/src/grclpl.f and
if your compiler doesn't have the IAND intrinsic, you should place
a function to replace it in your system directory. Its purpose is
simply to return the bitwise logical AND of two FORTRAN
integers.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>C routines</b></dt>

<dd><p>Where C routines have been used, you should be aware that there
is no guaranteed way to portably call C from FORTRAN. The C
routines in pgplot/sys/ support the two most common conventions,
both of which are based on the convention used in the original BSD
f77 compiler. In the BSD f77 convention, FORTRAN symbols are
converted to lower-case and postfixed with an underscore when
exported to the linker, all arguments are passed by pointer, and
the lengths of any string arguments are silently appended to the
end of the argument list. A common modification to the BSD f77
convention, is to omit the trailing underscore. If you need the
trailing underscore, (this is the most common convention), then you
must include -DPG_PPU in the configuration file CFLAGS assignment.</p>

<p>If neither of the above conventions are supported by your
compiler, then you will have to copy the C routines to the new
system directory and modify them to support the calling conventions
on your system.</p>

<p>Where C routines have been provided, they are usually based on
the availability of POSIX.1. If your machine doesn't support POSIX
yet, then you will have some changes to make - particularly as
regards terminal I/O routines. If your system is of BSD decent,
then try the BSD compatible terminal I/O routines in the
pgplot/sys_convex/ system directory.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Wrapper routines for C drivers</b></dt>

<dd><p>As mentioned above there is no portable way to call C from
FORTRAN, yet there are several drivers that are written in C in the
pgplot/drivers/ directory. A prominent example is the X-windows
drivers pgplot/drivers/xwdriv.c. Such drivers only understand the
two calling conventions mentioned above. Unlike the system
routines, the drivers are complicated, so for maintenance reasons
it would be unwise to modify copies of them just to support a new
calling convention. Instead, makemake checks to see if there are
any C wrapper functions in the system directory. These are routines
that act as intermediaries between FORTRAN and the unmodified
drivers, and makemake arranges to have both the original driver
code and wrapper code compiled and linked. In order that makemake
detect such wrapper functions, for driver code called xxdriv.c, the
wrapper function should be called xxwrap.c, where the two letter
prefix xx names a particular driver.</p>

<p>The same mechanism can be used for Objective C drivers, in which
case the file would be called xxwrap.m. However as mentioned before
you should try to stick to C and FORTRAN code if possible.</p>

<p>Note that there is no requirement that you support all of the
drivers in the pgplot/drivers/ directory. Many of them are targeted
at specific systems, and others are for rare devices. When first
porting PGPLOT, you should probably first stick to a small simple
subset until PGPLOT appears to be working reliably, then re-run
makemake with a larger selection of drivers uncommented to test
more of them.</p>
