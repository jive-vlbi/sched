<H2>MS-DOS machines running Lahey F77 32-bit FORTRAN</H2>

This PGPLOT driver is for IBM PC's and clones running MS-DOS and Lahey
F77 32-bit Fortran v5.0.  The driver will put the display into
graphics mode, and calls to `close' the workstation (PGEND) will set
it back into the previous mode (generally erasing the display, so don't
do it until you are really finished).<P>

This routine must be compiled and linked with the Lahey graphics
library GRAPH3 supplied with Lahey Fortran v4.0 or greater.<P>

<DL>
<DT>Supported device
<DD>IBM PC's and compatibles.
<DT>Device type code
<DD><CODE>/LH</CODE>
<DT>Default device name
<DD>None (the device name, if specified, is ignored).
<DT>Default view surface dimensions
<DD>Depends on monitor, typically 7x10 inches.

<DT>Resolution
<DD>Depends on graphics card.  Tested with a 640x480
VGA card.  Driver should work with other graphics cards.

<DT>Color capability
<DD>Color indices 0-15 are accepted.  The PGPLOT
color indices are mapped into the IBM color indices for with the
default color most closely corresponds to the PGPLOT default color.
Thus, PGPLOT index 2 (red) maps to IBM index 12 (light red).

<DT>Input capability
<DD>Graphics cursor implemented using Microsoft Mouse or compatible,
accessed through DOS calls. 

<DT>File format
<DD>None.
