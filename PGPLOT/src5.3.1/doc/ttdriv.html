<H2>PGPLOT: Tektronix Terminals and Emulators</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>This device driver can be used only on UNIX and VMS systems.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<DL>

<P><DT><B>Supported device</B>
<DD><OL>
<LI>Tektronix 4006/4010 storage-tube terminal; can be used with
    emulators, but the options below take advantage of features not
    present in the basic Tektronix terminal.
<LI>GraphOn Corporation 200-series terminals. These emulate a
    Tektronix-4010 with enhancements (selective erase, rectangle fill,
    switch between Tek and VT100 modes).
<LI>Digital Engineering, Inc., Retrographics modified VT100
    terminal (VT640). 
<LI>IRAF GTERM Tektronix terminal emulator, with color extensions.
<LI>Xterm window on an X-window server. Emulates a Tektronix-4014,
    with extensions (switch between Tek and VT100 windows).
<LI>ZSTEM 240 and ZSTEM 4014 terminal emulators for the IBM PC and
    clones. ZSTEM supports Tektronix 4014 emulation and the 4105 color
    escape sequences. ZSTEM can be obtained from: KEA Systems Ltd.,
    2150 West Broadway, Suite 412, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada,
    V6K 4L9.
<LI>Visual-603 and 630 terminals. These are VT100/220 compatible
    terminals with Tektronix 4010/4014 emulation (Visual Technology
    Incorporated, 1703 Middlesex Street, Lowell, Mass 01851). The 
    Visual 630 has the capability of displaying dual text and graphics.
    This feature is not used in this driver. Graphics mode is entered 
    automatically when the graph is drawn but only exited when PGPAGE 
    or PGEND is called. Therefore, for multiple plots interspersed
    with text I/O, use PGPAGE at the end of each plot. This will prompt
    for a carriage return before switching. If this is not done,
    intervening text will appear on the graphics screen. Graphics mode
    can be entered and exited from the setup menu, or by SHIFT-PF1.
    Graphics extensions include rectangle fill, selective erase and 
    switch between Tek and VT100 modes.
<LI>IBM PC's and compatibles running MS-Kermit 3 as a terminal emulator.
    The video board is assumed to have sufficient memory to retain the 
    graphics image in memory when switched to text. This will be true 
    for VGA and EGA, but some early PCs might not be able to do this. 
    If Kermit is using full VGA resolution (ie SET TERMINAL GRAPHICS 
    VGA), there is not usually enough memory to store the full 480 
    vertical lines, so the bottom few lines may disappear. Tektronix 
    enhancements include selective erase, colours, rectangle fill, and
    switching between text and graphics mode. The cursor may be
    operated with the mouse. Tested with Kermit version 3.1.
<LI>Tektronix 4100 series color terminals (and emulators, e.g.,
    Versaterm-PRO for Macintosh).

<P><DT><B>Default device name</B>
<DD>The logged-in terminal: <CODE>/dev/tty</CODE> (UNIX),
                            <CODE>TT:</CODE> (VMS).

<P><DT><B>Default view surface dimensions</B>
<DD>Depends on monitor; nominally 8in (horizontal) by 6in (vertical).

<P><DT><B>Resolution</B>
<DD>A standard Tektronix terminal displays a screen of 1024 pixels
   (horizontal) by 780 pixels (vertical), with a nominal resolution
   of 130 pixels per inch. The actual resolution may be less.

<P><DT><B>Color capability</B>
<DD><UL>
<LI>/TEK4010, /XTERM: none; only color index 1 is available; selective
       erase is not possible. Requests to draw in color index 0 are
       ignored.
<LI>/GF, /RETRO, /V603: color indices 0 (erase, black) and 1 (bright:
       usually white, green or amber) are supported. It is not 
       possible to change color representation.
<LI>/GTERM:  color indices 0 to 15 are available and default to the
       standard PGPLOT colors. The color representation can be changed.
<LI>/ZSTEM: color indices 0 to 7 are available and default to the
       indicated in the ZSTEM setup menu (which default to the standard
       PGPLOT colors).  The color representation cannot be changed.
<LI>/KRM3: color indices 0 to 7 are the standard PGPLOT colors. Indices
       8 to 14 are also available, but are BRIGHT versions of 1 to 7,
       and thus non-standard. Color representation can't be changed.
<LI>/TK4100: color indices 0-15.
</UL>

<P><DT><B>Input capability</B>
<DD>Depending on the emulation, the graphics cursor may be a pointer,
   a small cross, or a crosshair across the entire screen. The user
   positions the cursor using thumbwheels, mouse, trackball, or the
   arrow keys on the keyboard. The user indicates that the cursor has
   been positioned by typing any printable ASCII character on the 
   keyboard. Most control characters (eg, ^C) are intercepted by the
   operating system and cannot be used. 

<P><DT><B>File format </B>
<DD>Binary byte stream. Under Unix, the output may be directed to
a file; under VMS, this is not possible: the output device must
be a terminal.
