<H1>Primitives</H1>

<P>Having opened a graphics device and defined the viewport and the
window, we are ready to draw the substance of the image that is to
appear within the viewport.  This chapter describes the most basic
routines, called <I>primitives</I>, that can be used for drawing
elements of the image.  There are four different sorts of primitive:
<I>lines, graph-markers, text</I>, and <I>area fill</I>.  The <A
HREF="attributes.html">next chapter</A> explains how to change the
<I>attributes</I> of these primitives, e.g., color, line-style, and text
font.</P>

<P>The primitive routines can be used in any combination and order after
the viewport and window have been defined.  They all indicate where
the primitive is to appear on the view surface by specifying world
coordinates. See the <A HREF="subroutines.html">subroutine descriptions</A>
for more details.</P>

<H2>Clipping</H2>

<P>The primitives are &ldquo;clipped&rdquo; at the edge of the viewport: any parts 
of the image that would appear outside the viewport are suppressed.  The 
various primitives behave slightly differently. A <I>line</I> is
clipped where it crosses the edge of the viewport. A <I>graph marker</I>
is plotted if the center (the point marked) lies within or on the edge 
of the viewport; otherwise it is suppressed. <I>Text</I>, which is 
usually used for annotation, is not clipped (except at the edge of the 
view surface). A <I>filled area</I> is clipped at the edge of the
viewport.

<P>In rare cases, it is useful to disable clipping of lines and graph
markers; this can be done with routine <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGSCLP">PGSCLP</A>. However, it is usually
better to redefine the viewport rather than trying to draw outside
it.</P>

<H2>Lines</H2>

<P>The primitive line-drawing routine is <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGLINE">PGLINE</A>.  This draws one or more
connected straight-line segments (generally called a <I>polyline</I>
in computer graphics).  It has three arguments: the integer number
(<CODE>N</CODE>) of points defining the polyline, and two real or
float arrays (<CODE>XPTS</CODE> and <CODE>YPTS</CODE>) containing the
world <I>x</I> and <I>y</I>-coordinates of the points.  The polyline
consists of N-1 straight-line segments connecting points 1-2, 2-3,
..., (N-1)-N:</p>
<PRE class="f">CALL PGLINE(N, XPTS, YPTS)
</PRE>
<PRE class="c">cpgline(n, xpts, ypts);
</PRE>


<P>The two routines <A HREF="subroutines.html#PGMOVE">PGMOVE</A> and
<A HREF="subroutines.html#PGDRAW">PGDRAW</A> are even more primitive
than PGLINE, in the sense that any line graph can be produced by
calling these two routines alone.  In general, PGLINE should be
preferred, as it is more modular. PGMOVE and PGDRAW are provided for
those who are used to Calcomp-style plotting packages.  PGMOVE moves
the plotter &ldquo;pen&rdquo; to a specified point, without drawing a line
(&ldquo;pen up&rdquo;). It has two arguments: the world-coordinates of the
required new pen position.  PGDRAW moves the plotter &ldquo;pen&rdquo; from its
current position (defined by the last call of PGMOVE or PGDRAW) to a
new point, drawing a straight line as it goes (&ldquo;pen down&rdquo;).  The
above call to PGLINE could be replaced by the following:

<PRE class="f">CALL PGMOVE(XPTS(1), YPTS(1))
DO I=2,N
    CALL PGDRAW XPTS(I), YPTS(I))
END DO
</PRE>

<PRE class="c">cpgmove(xpts[0], ypts[0]);
for (i=1; i &lt; n; i++)
    cpgdraw(xpts[i], ypts[i]);
</PRE>
<p>(Note: Fortran array indices usually start at 1 while C array indices 
start at 0.)</p>

<P>To draw an <i>arc of a circle</i>, use routine <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGARC">PGARC</A>. This routine has five
arguments: the (<I>x,y</I>) world coordinates of the center, the
radius in world coordinates, and two angles defining the endpoints of
the arc. The following example draws a quadrant (90° segment).</p>

<PRE class="f">CALL PGARC(X, Y, RADIUS, 0.0, 90.0)
</PRE>
<PRE class="c">cpgarc(x, y, radius, 0.0, 90.0);
</PRE>

<p>This routine can be used to draw a complete circle, by specifying two
angles 360° apart; it is also possible to use <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGCIRC">PGCIRC</A> with fill-style 2
(outline). PGPLOT approximates the arc by straight-line segments.
</P>



<H2>Graph Markers</H2>

<P>A Graph Marker is a symbol, such as a cross, dot, or circle, drawn on
a graph to mark a specific point. Usually the symbol used will be
chosen to be symmetrical with a well-defined center. The routine <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGPT1">PGPT1</A> draws a single graph marker at
a specified world-coordinate point; while <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGPT">PGPT</A> draws several graph markers
(sometimes called a <I> polymarker</I>) at a set or points specified
by arrays of coordinates.  PGPT has three arguments: the real/float
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> world-coordinates of the point and an integer
number identifying the symbol to use. PGPT has four arguments: the
number of points to mark, two arrays containing the world <I>x</I> and
<I>y</I>-coordinates of the points, and a symbol number:

<PRE CLASS="F">    CALL PGPT1(X, Y, NSYM)
    REAL XPTS(N), YPTS(N)
    CALL PGPT (N, XPTS, YPTS, NSYM)
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="C">    cpgpt1(x, y, nsym);
    float xpts[n], ypts[n];
    cpgpt(n, xpts, ypts, nsym);
</PRE>

<p>The symbol number can be:</p>
<UL>
<LI>-1, to draw a dot of the smallest possible
size;
<LI>0 - 31, to draw any one of the symbols in <A HREF="#FIG41">Figure 5.1</A>;
<LI>-3 - -8, to draw a filled regular polygon with 3--8 sides;
<LI>33--127, to draw the
corresponding ASCII character (the character is taken from the
currently selected text font);
<LI>&gt;127, to draw one of the Hershey
symbols from <A HREF="hershey.html">Chapter 11</A>.
</UL>

<p>For example, to use letter <I>F</I> as the marker:</p>

<PRE CLASS="F">    CALL PGPT1(0.5, 0.75, ICHAR('F') ) 
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="C">    cpgpt1(0.5, 0.75, 'F' );
</PRE>

<p>(<CODE>ICHAR</CODE> is the Fortran intrinsic function that returns the
integer value of a character.)</P>

<H2>Text</H2>

<P>The Text primitive routine is used for writing labels and titles on
the image.  It converts an internal computer representation of the
text (ASCII codes) into readable text.  (The correspondence between
codes and representations is given in <A HREF="hershey.html">Appendix B</A>.) The simplest routine for
writing text is <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGTEXT">PGTEXT</A>, which writes a
horizontal character string starting at a specific <I>(x,y)</I> world
coordinate position, e.g.,

<PRE CLASS="F">    CALL PGTEXT(X, Y, 'A text string')
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="C">    cpgtext(x, y, "A text string");
</PRE>

<p>PGTEXT is actually a simplified interface to the more
general primitive routine <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGPTXT">PGPTXT</A>, which allows one to
change orientation and justification of the text, e.g.,</p> 

<PRE CLASS="F">    CALL PGPTXT (X, Y, 45.0, 0.5, 'A text string')
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="C">    cpgptxt(x, y, 45.0, 0.5, "A text string");
</PRE>

<p>which writes the text at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal, centered
at <I>(x,y)</I>.</P>

<P>Both PGTEXT and PGPTXT require the position of the text string to
be specified in world coordinates.  When annotating a graph, it is
usually more convenient to position the text relative to the edge of
the viewport, rather than in world-coordinate space.  The routine <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGMTXT">PGMTXT</A> is provided for this, and <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGLAB">PGLAB</A> provides a simple interface to
PGMTXT for the normal job of annotating an <I>(x,y)</I> graph.</P>

<P>The appearance of text can be altered by specifying a number of
<I>attributes</I>, described in the next chapter.  In particular, the
character size and character font can be changed. <A HREF="#FIG42">Figure
5.2</A> illustrates some of the possibilities.</P>


<H3>Escape Sequences</H3>

<P>The routine PGPTXT (and all the other PGPLOT text-plotting routines,
e.g., PGTEXT, PGLAB) allows one to
include <I>escape sequences</I> in the text string to be
plotted. These are character-sequences that are not plotted, but are
interpreted as instructions to change font, draw superscripts or
subscripts, draw non-ASCII characters (e.g., Greek letters), etc.  All
escape sequences start with a backslash character
(<CODE>\</CODE>). 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that in C, and some varieties of Fortran, <i>two</i> backslash
characters (<code>\\</code>) are required to prevent special
interpretation by the compiler.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>The following escape sequences are defined (the
letter following the <CODE>\</CODE> may be either upper or lower
case):</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 summary="PGPLOT escape sequences"> 

<TR><TD>\u</TD>
    <TD>start a superscript, or end a subscript</TD></TR>

    <TD>character number <I>nnnn</i> (1 to 4 decimal digits) from the Hershey character set;
the closing parenthesis may be omitted if the next character is neither
a digit nor &ldquo;)&rdquo;.  This makes a number of special characters (e.g.,
mathematical, musical, astronomical, and cartographical symbols)
available.  See <A HREF="hershey.html">Appendix B</A> for a list of available characters. </TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>As an example, here is the code required to write</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <I>H</i><sub>0</sub> = 75 ± 25 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc<sup>-1</sup>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE CLASS="F">    CALL PGTEXT(X, Y, '\fiH\d0\u \fr= 75 \(2233) 25 km s\u-1\d Mpc\u-1\d')
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="C">    cpgtext(x, y, "\\fiH\\d0\\u \\fr= 75 \\(2233) 25 km s\\u-1\\d Mpc\\u-1\\d");
</PRE>

<H2>Area Fill: Polygons, Rectangles, and Circles</H2>

<P>The Area Fill primitives allow the programmer to shade the interior
of an arbitrary polygonal or circular region.  The appearance of the
primitive is controlled by attributes <I>fill area style</I> and
<I>color index</I> (see <A HREF="attributes.html">next
chapter</A>). Note that one fill-style option is <I>hollow</I>, i.e.,
draw the outline only.</P>

<P>The routine <A HREF="subroutines.html#PGPOLY">PGPOLY</A>
is used to fill an area defined as a <b>polygon</b>.  It has three arguments:
the number (<CODE>N</CODE>) of vertices defining the polygon, and two
arrays (<CODE>XPTS</CODE> and <CODE>YPTS</CODE>) containing the world
<I>x</I> and <I>y</I>-coordinates of the vertices:

<PRE CLASS="F">    CALL PGPOLY(N, XPTS, YPTS)
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="C">    cppoly(n, xpts, ypts);
</PRE>

<p>If the polygon is not convex, it may not be obvious which points in the
image are inside the polygon. PGPLOT assumes that a point is inside the
polygon if a straight line drawn from the point to infinity intersects
an odd number of the polygon's edges.</P>

<P>For the special case of a <b>rectangle</b> with edges parallel to the
coordinate axes, it is better to use routine <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGRECT">PGRECT</A> instead of
PGPOLY; this routine will use the hardware rectangle-fill
capability if available. PGRECT has four arguments: the
(<I>x,y</I>) world coordinates of two opposite corners (note the order
of the arguments):</p>

<PRE CLASS="F">    CALL PGRECT(X1, X2, Y1, Y2)
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="C">    cpgrect(x1, x2, y1, y2);
</PRE>

<P>To draw a <b>circle</b> use routine <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGCIRC">PGCIRC</A>. This routine has
three arguments: the (<I>x,y</I>) world coordinates of the center,
and the radius in world coordinates. Note that a circle may appear
elliptical if the world-coordinate scaling is not the same in <I>x</I>
and <I>y</I>.</p>
<PRE CLASS="F">    CALL PGCIRC(X, Y, RADIUS)
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="C">    cpgcirc(x, y, radius);
</PRE>


<P>To fill a <b>sector of a circle</b> (defined by two radii and the
included arc of the circle), use routine <A
HREF="subroutines.html#PGPIE">PGPIE</A>. This routine has five
arguments: the (<I>x,y</I>) world coordinates of the center, the
radius in world coordinates, and two angles defining the endpoints of
the arc. The following example draws a quadrant (90° segment).</p>

<PRE CLASS="F">    CALL PGPIE(X, Y, RADIUS, 0.0, 90.0)
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="C">    cpgpie(x, y, radius, 0.0, 90.0);
</PRE>
