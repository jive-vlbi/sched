<H1>Installation Instructions: VMS systems</H1>

<I>Version 5.2.0</I><P>

<B>Note:</B> The following instructions refer to two directories, the
<i>distribution (source) directory</i> which will contain the PGPLOT source
code directory tree, and the <i>binary directory</i> in which the
machine-specific libraries, data files, and demonstration programs
will be created. It is recommended that you create new, <i>empty</i>
directories for these. They should not be the same directory. In the
examples below, these directories are named<P>

<code>USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT]</code> (distribution directory)<BR>
<code>USR:[LOCAL.PGBIN]</code> (binary directory)<P>

but you can use any convenient names. Unusual (system) privileges are
not required to install PGPLOT, assuming you have write access to the
directories. In a mixed VAX-Alpha cluster, you can use a single
distribution directory, but you will need two binary directories, one
for each architecture. The distribution directory may be deleted after
the installation has been competed, but it will be needed if you later
decide to select different device drivers.<P>

<H2>Copy the distribution file</H2>

Copy the distribution file by anonymous ftp from Caltech.  Use
anonymous ftp (user: <CODE>anonymous</CODE>, password: your id
<CODE>username@machine</CODE>) to node <CODE>astro.caltech.edu</CODE>
(131.215.240.1).<P>

The distribution file is a UNIX tar file compressed with Gzip.
Issue the following ftp commands to retrieve the file:<PRE> 
        cd pub/pgplot
	binary
	get pgplot5.2.tar.gz pgplot.tar-gz
</PRE>
(Note that you need to provide a VMS-compatible output file name in the
<code>get</code> command.)

<H2>Decompress the files</H2>

You will need two programs to decompress and extract the contents of
the distribution file: <code>gunzip</code> and
<code>vmstar</code>. These programs are not part of VMS, but are
widely available on the Internet, e.g., at<P>
<A HREF="http://www.openvms.digital.com/openvms/freeware/cd.html">http://www.openvms.digital.com/openvms/freeware/cd.html</A><P>

Use <code>gunzip</code> to
decompress the distribution file, e.g.,
<PRE>
	$ gunzip pgplot.tar-gz
</PRE>
Then use <code>vmstar</code> to extract the contents of the archive:
<PRE>
        $ set default USR:[LOCAL}
	$ vmstar/extract/verbose pgplot.tar
 OR     $ vmstar xvf pgplot.tar
	$ delete pgplot.tar;
</PRE>
This will create a subdirectory <code>[.PGPLOT]</code> (and
lower-level subdirectories) in the current directory, e.g.,
<code>USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT...]</code>. Make sure that your current
directory is where you want to create the ``PGPLOT distribution''
directory tree.

<H2>Create the binary directory</H2>

Create a writable directory in which the PGPLOT library and associated
files will be created. One such directory is needed for each different
binary system; e.g., you may want separate directories for VAX and
Alpha.
<PRE>
	$ create/directory USR:[LOCAL.PGBIN]
	$ set default USR:[LOCAL.PGBIN]
</PRE>
Do not try to create the PGPLOT library in the source (``distribution'')
directory.

<H2>Select device drivers</H2>

Configure PGPLOT by selecting device drivers from the available
list. First copy the file <CODE>drivers.list</CODE> from the
distribution directory to the binary directory, and then use a text
editor to select device drivers. This file contains one line for each
available device driver: delete the exclamation mark (!) at the
beginning of the line to include the driver, or ensure that an
exclamation mark is present if you want to exclude the driver. Many of
the drivers can be used only on certain operating systems (see notes
in <CODE>drivers.list</CODE>), so include <b>only the drivers you plan
to use</b>. PGPLOT can later be reconfigured by restarting the
installation at this step. Most installations should include: the null
device (/NULL), PostScript printers (/PS, /VPS, /CPS, and /VCPS),
Tektronix terminals (/TEK, /XTERM, and possibly other variants), and,
if the X window system (DECwindows) is available, the X
window drivers (/XWIN, /XSERV). You may also wish to include drivers
for GIF files (/GIF, /VGIF) or some of the other printers.<P>

<PRE>
	$ copy USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT]drivers.list []
	$ edit drivers.list
</PRE>
<P>

<H2>Compile the library and demonstration programs</H2>

Execute the script <CODE>install.com</CODE> from the VMS subdirectory
of the distribution directory, e.g.:
<PRE>
	$ @USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT.SYS_VMS]install USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT]
</PRE>
The first argument supplied to <CODE>install</CODE> is the name of the
distribution directory. The script will attempt to determine your machine
architecture (VAX or Alpha) and compile appropriate code. The script has been
tested under several versions of VMS, but if you have problems, you may need
to edit the script.<P>

The install script issues messages as it proceeds: it usually takes 
quite a long time. It should generate the following files:
<PRE>
	DRIVERS.LIST
	GREXEC.F
	GRFONT.DAT
	GRPCKG.OLB
	GRPSHR.EXE
	GRPSHR.OLB
	PGDEMO1.EXE ... PGDEMO16.EXE
	PGXWIN_SERVER.EXE
	RGB.TXT
</PRE>
The script assumes that you have the current DEC Fortran and C
compilers installed. A C compiler is required for XWDRIV and X2DRIV
and the associated programs PGXWIN_SERVER and PGDISP, and for
generating the C wrapper library CPGPLOT.OLB. If you don't have the
DEC C compiler, the script will have to be modified.<P>

The script may fail if you redefine any of the common DCL commands
like PURGE or DELETE.<P>

<B>Note:</B> Demonstration program <code>pgdemo14</code> is compiled
incorrectly by the DEC Fortran 6.2 compiler when optimization is
enabled; the symptom is that the labels like "Number of Vertices:" do
not appear on the screen. The problem is solved by disabling
optimization.<P>

<H2>Compile the optional components</H2>

<H3>C wrapper library</H3>

To install the optional C wrapper library, proceed as follows.
<PRE>
	$ @USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT.SYS_VMS]install USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT] CPG
</PRE>
This creates three files:
<PRE>
	CPGPLOT.H	(ANSI C header file)
	CPGPLOT.OLB	(library containing the C binding)
	CPGDEMO.EXE	(demonstration program)
</PRE>
<P>

<H3>PGDISP program</H3>

The PGDISP program is required if you selected the /XDISP device
driver.  Use of this driver is not recommended: you should use the
standard X Window driver (/XWIN or /XSERV) instead.
<PRE>
	$ @USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT.SYS_VMS]install USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT] PGDISP
</PRE>
This adds one file, <CODE>PGDISP.EXE</CODE>.
The PGDISP program sometimes gives compilation problems. Most of
these are non-fatal warnings that can be ignored.<P>

<H3>Motif support and example files</H3>

If you plan to develop Motif applications that use the PGPLOT widget,
or if you want to inspect a sample Motif application, you will need to
do this step. You must first: (a) ensure that the Motif header files
and libraries are installed on your system; (b) select XMDRIV in
<code>drivers.list</code> before installing the PGPLOT library; and
(c) install the C wrapper library.

Execute the following command:
<PRE>
        $ @USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT.SYS_VMS]install USR:[LOCAL.PGPLOT] PGMDEMO
</PRE>
This creates five files:
<PRE>
	PGMDEMO.EXE     (executable demo program)
	PGMOTIF.OPT     (linker options file for linking PGPLOT/Motif applications)
	PGXWIN.OBJ      (object module required by PGPLOT/Motif applications)
	XMPGPLOT.OBJ	(object module required by PGPLOT/Motif applications)
	XMPGPLOT.H      (header file required by PGPLOT/Motif applications)
</PRE>
(This step may not work on all VMS systems: there are many differences
between the various available versions of the DEC C compiler and
DECwindows Motif. If you get error messages, you may need to modify
file <code>[local.pgplot.sys_vms]make_pgmdemo.com</code>.)<P>


<H2>Define logical names</H2>

Before running any PGPLOT program, you must ensure that the following
logical names are correctly defined. The logical names may be placed
in the process table or the system table. It may be convenient to place
the definitions in <code>LOGIN.COM</code>. 
<DL>
<DT><B>GRPSHR</B>
<DD>This should point to the PGPLOT shared library,
<code>GRPSHR.EXE</code>, with complete directory information, e.g.,
<PRE>
      $ define GRPSHR PGPLOT_DIR:GRPSHR.EXE
</PRE>
If this logical name is not defined, RUN will look for
<code>GRPSHR.EXE</code> in the system library directory
(<code>SYS$LIBRARY</code>).<P>

<DT><B>PGPLOT_DIR</B>
<DD>This is the name of the directory in which PGPLOT
will look for the files <CODE>grfont.dat</CODE> and
<CODE>rgb.txt</CODE> (unless logical names <CODE>PGPLOT_FONT</CODE>
and <CODE>PGPLOT_RGB</CODE> are defined to override this default
behavior), and, if needed, the X-window server program
<CODE>pgxwin_server</CODE>:
<PRE>
        $ define PGPLOT_DIR USR:[LOCAL.PGBIN]
</PRE>

<DT><B>PGPLOT_DEV</B>
<DD>It is also convenient, but not essential, to define a default PGPLOT
device with logical name <CODE>PGPLOT_DEV</CODE>, e.g.
<PRE>
        $ define PGPLOT_DEV      "/xwin"
</PRE>

<DT><B>LNK$LIBRARY</B>
<DD>If you develop PGPLOT programs, you can arrange for the linker to
automatically scan the PGPLOT library by naming <code>GRPSHR.OLB</CODE>
in one of the <code>LNK$LIBRARY*</CODE> logical names, e.g.
<PRE>
      $ define LNK$LIBRARY PGPLOT_DIR:GRPSHR.OLB
</PRE>
If you do not do this, you will need to include this library (note: <code>GRPSHR.OLB</code>, not <code>GRPSHR.EXE</code>) in your LINK commands.
</DL>
Other PGPLOT logical names (environment variables) are described in
the manual.<P>

<H2>Run the demonstration programs</H2>

Run the demonstration programs on your selected devices and verify
that they run satisfactorily.<P>

To run a program,  use the RUN command:
<PRE>
	$ run pgdemo1
	$ run pgdemo2
	...
	$ run cpgdemo    ! optional component
	$ run pgmdemo    ! optional component
</PRE>

All the demonstration programs prompt for a device name and type. Type
a question mark <CODE>?</CODE> to see a list of the available device
types and verify that PGPLOT has been configured properly.<P>

Points to check for: the PGPLOT program correctly reads the font file
and displays superscripts, subscripts and special characters
(pgdemo2); the PGPLOT program can read the color database (pgdemo10);
on interactive devices, the cursor works correctly (pgdemo5, pgdemo6).

<H2>Install the documentation files</H2>

Unlike the UNIX installation procedure, the VMS installation procedure
does not generate documentation. A list of subroutine synopses is available in a variety of formats by anonymous ftp from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/DOC/">ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/DOC/</A>:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/DOC/pgplot.doc">pgplot.doc</A>
	(plain ASCII file)
<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/DOC/pgplot.hlp">pgplot.hlp</A>
	(VMS help format)
<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/DOC/pgplot.html">pgplot.html</A>
	(HTML [WWW] format)
<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/pgplot/DOC/pgplot.ps">pgplot.ps</A>
	(PostScript)
</UL>
The help file can be installed in a VMS help library with a DCL command like
the following:
<PRE>
	$ library/insert/help pgplot.hlb pgplot.hlp
</PRE><P>
