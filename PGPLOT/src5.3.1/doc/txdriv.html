<H2>TeX PK Font file</H2>
<DL>
                                                             
<DT>Supported device
<DD>PK Font files for TeX.
                                                          
<DT>Device type code
<DD><CODE>/TX</CODE>
                                                         
<DT>Default file names
<DD><CODE>pgplot.RESpk</CODE>, <CODE>pgplot.tfm</CODE> where the 
<CODE>RES</CODE> is a default value of 300 but may be set to something
else.  If <CODE>RES</CODE>=300, then the default file names would be
<CODE>pgplot.300pk</CODE> and <CODE>pgplot.tfm</CODE>.
If more than 15 font characters are produced, then the file
names become <CODE>pgplot_2.300pk</CODE> and <CODE>pgplot_2.tfm</CODE>, etc., 
for each set of 15 characters output (i.e., for each PK
font produced).
                                                            
<DT>Default view surface dimensions
<DD>2.8  x  2.8 inches.
May be overridden by the environment variables <CODE>PGPLOT_TX_YINCHES</CODE>,
and <CODE>PGPLOT_TX_XINCHES</CODE>
<PRE>
$DEFINE PGPLOT_TX_XINCHES &quot;5.0&quot;   
$DEFINE PGPLOT_TX_YINCHES &quot;4.5&quot;
</PRE>
would provide a view surface of 5.0 inches horizontally
by 4.5 inches vertically.
                     
<DT>Resolution
<DD>300 dots per inch.
May be overridden by the logicals
<CODE>PGPLOT_TX_XRESOL</CODE> and <CODE>PGPLOT_TX_YRESOL</CODE>:
<PRE>
$DEFINE PGPLOT_TX_XRESOL &quot;78.0&quot; 
$DEFINE PGPLOT_TX_YRESOL &quot;78.0&quot;
</PRE>
will produce a font at 78 dots per inch
resolution.  This would be good for a
Vaxstation 2000 workstation.
The default 300 dots per inch is good for a
laser printer such as a QMS1200 LaserGrafix 
or an HP2000 LaserJet.
                                                
<DT>Color capability
<DD>Color indices 0 (erase, white) and 1 (black) are
supported. It is not possible to change color representation.
                                                
<DT>Output Orientation
<DD>Portrait.  (Can be overridden by setting the
environment variable <CODE>PGPLOT_TX_ORIENT</CODE> = <CODE>LANDSCAPE</CODE>.)
                                                   
<DT>Input capability
<DD>None.
                                                        
<DT>File formats
<DD>TeX PK Font file format, and TeX
TFM file format.  The files are output as
FORTRAN, DIRECT ACCESS, UNFORMATTED, 
512 BYTE RECORDS so that we can have
compatability with the VAX and our
UNIX machine.  A raw bitmap copy is
also possible if you define the logical
<CODE>PGPLOT_TX_BITFILE</CODE>:
<PRE>
$ DEFINE PGPLOT_TX_BITFILE &quot;MINIMAL&quot;
</PRE>
will produce a file copy of the portion
of the bitmap which is within the minimal
bounding box of the character.
<PRE>
$ DEFINE PGPLOT_TX_BITFILE &quot;ALL&quot; 
</PRE>
will produce
a file copy of the complete bitmap of the
graphics character.
                                                      
<DT>Obtaining hardcopy
<DD>Use the command DUMP to view the
output files, or run TeX and include the
character of this new font and DVI the output
and print the resulting  binary file to the
correct printer (with PASSALL, NOFEED, or
whatever is required for printing binary
output to your specific printer). Also, the
PKTYPE and TFTOPL TeX debugging programs will
allow you to view your output font
characteristics.

<DT>TeX Example
<DD> Assume you have produced a graph into a
PK Font and that the output file names are <CODE>pgplot.300pk</CODE> 
and <CODE>pgplot.tfm</CODE> then the following lines in your TeX code
would include the graph corresponding to the letter A
of the TeX PK font &quot;PGPLOT&quot; in the middle of your paper:
<PRE>                                                                
      \font\myfntname=pgplot
       This is sentence one of the TeX file.
       Now I will include the character.
      \centerline{\myfntname A }
       This is the last sentence.
      \bye
</PRE>                                                        
The above example for LaTeX would be: 
<PRE>                                                    
    This is the first sentence.
    Now I will include the character as a figure.
    \begin{figure}
     \newfont{\myfntname}{pgplot}
     \centerline{\myfntname A}
     \caption{Letter A of PGPLOT font}
    \end{figure}
    This is the last sentence.
</PRE>
Of course, you must tell TeX and the DVI driver where to find your
fonts.  On our VAX, we have defined a search list so that if you define
the logical <CODE>TEX_USER_FONTS</CODE> to be your directory where you keep your
fonts, then TeX and the DVI driver will find the <CODE>pgplot.tfm</CODE> file and
the <CODE>pgplot.300pk</CODE> file.  So, 
<PRE>
  $DEFINE TEX_USER_FONTS  SYS$USERDISK:[USERNAME.FONTS]
</PRE>
  would cause TeX and the DVI driver to search the normal
  search path and also the directory 
  <CODE>SYS$USERDISK:[USERNAME.FONTS]</CODE> for any fonts that you
  specified in your TeX file.  (Here is an exception for
  UNIX. Our UNIX TeX and DVI programs will look in your
  current directory automatically for the fonts and then
  will check the system library if it cannot find the
  fonts in your directory.)
                                                   
<DT>Notes
<DD>    You must change the resolution for different output
  devices (our DVI driver, DVIHP, for our HP2000 LaserJet
  would use a resolution of 300 dots per inch; while our
  DVI driver for the Vaxstation 2000 workstation would
  need a resolution of 78 dots per inch.  The <CODE>pgplot.tfm</CODE>
  file would of course be the same in both cases, but the  
  DVI drivers would look for <CODE>pgplot.300pk</CODE> and <CODE>pgplot.78pk</CODE>
  respectively).  If you produce an image which is too large
  (by defining logicals <CODE>PGPLOT_TX_XINCHES</CODE> and <CODE>PGPLOT_TX_YINCHES</CODE>)
  then some DVI drivers will leave the page blank where the
  graph of the character belongs (can sometimes use <CODE>\hsize</CODE> and
  <CODE>\vsize</CODE> to help with this).  Finally,  if your device driver
  only works with PXL files (like our PRINTRONIX DVI driver),
  then you may want to run the   PKTOPX  program to convert
  the PK Font into a PXL Font which your device driver needs.
