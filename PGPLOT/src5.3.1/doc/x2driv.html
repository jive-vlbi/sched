<H2>PGDISP or FIGDISP server for X Window workstations</H2>

The figdisp server is part of Figaro: it maintains a ``line graphics''
window which can be addressed by PGPLOT using the /XDISP device
type. The pgdisp server is a subset of figdisp that shows only the
line graphics window. Both server programs run in the background and
keep the PGPLOT window open. (Most users will prefer to use /XSERV
instead of /XDISP).

<H3>Starting PGDISP</H3>

To start up the pgdisp server (in the background), use
<PRE>
% pgdisp [options] &
</PRE>
You can change the size of the server window with the mouse.  You can
also use standard -geometry and -display options with pgdisp. PGPLOT
will adapt to the size selected, but it is not possible to change the
size of a graph after it has been displayed. To remove the server,
select Quit from its menu.

If the pgdisp program is not in a directory in your path, you will need to use the full file name (or create an alias), e.g.,
<PRE>
% /usr/local/pgplot/pgdisp [options] &
</PRE>

<H3>Redirecting the Display</H3>

Before starting pgdisp, both the Figaro and the X11 environment must be
set  up.  The X11 environment consists of setting the DISPLAY
environment variable  appropriately.  For example:
<PRE>
% setenv DISPLAY :0
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
% setenv DISPLAY lo-fan:0.0
</PRE>

The first example would cause the display to appear on the local machine.  
Other values which can be used to accomplish this are "unix:0.0" and
"lhost:0.0", where lhost is the name of the local host.

<H3>Multiple Copies</H3>

If you wish to start up a second copy of pgdisp, type the line
<PRE>
% pgdisp -id # [options] &
</PRE>
where # represents any integer.  Note that there cannot be a copy of figdisp
and a copy of pgdisp running on the same screen with the same id. To
send graphics to a particular pgdisp window, specify the id number
before /XDISP, e.g., "1/XDISP". The default is 0.

<H3>Options</H3>

The PGDISP window uses a default of 16 colors (2 if on a monochrome
screen or it can't get 16 colors for some reason), but this can be
changed with the lineColors resource. You need more than 16 colors for
PGPLOT gray-scales; I recommend 64. More than 64 colors is likely to
steal too many from other windows.<P>

The window can be resized arbitrarily.  The initial size is determined
by the figdisp.lg.geometry resource.  Since PGPLOT  automatically scales
to use the entire window, the line graphics window should not be resized
while a program is accessing it.  If  this is done, the display server
will not crash, but the output will look odd, and cursor positioning may
be incorrect.<P>

The window title is updated to show the position of the cursor  when the
cursor is in the line graphics window.<P>

<PRE>
Command Line Option	X resource	Default	Notes
</PRE>
<HR>
<PRE>
-display disp		.display	none	The display on which the
						display server should run.

-id #			.id		0	The id number of this copy of
						figdisp or pgdisp.  An
						arbitrary number of copies of
						figdisp/pgdisp may be run at
						the same time, as long as each
						one's id number is unique.

-geometry WxH[+x+y]			512x512	This flag corresponds to
						.bm.geometry in figdisp and
						.lg.geometry in pgdisp

-lgGeometry WxH[+x+y]	.lg.geometry	512x512	The line graphics window
						geometry.


-lineColors #		.lineColors	16	The number of colors to use for
						line graphics.

-visual			.visual		Any	The visual to use.  Accepted
						values include the X11 visuals
						PseudoColor and GrayScale, as
						well as Default (only the
						default visual is allowed) and
						Any (any visual is allowed) for
						either pgdisp or figdisp.
						Pgdisp also allows the X11
						visual classes StaticGray,
						StaticColor, DirectColor, and
						TrueColor.

-lgCrosshair            .lg.Crosshair           Specify to get
                                                cross-hair cursor.
