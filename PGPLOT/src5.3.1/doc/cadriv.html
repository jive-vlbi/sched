<H2>Canon Laser Printer</H2>
<DL>

<DT>Supported device
<DD> Canon LBP-8/A2 Laser printer. Conforms to
ISO 646, 2022, 2375 and 6429 specifications. VDM (graphics) conforms to
proposed American National Standard VDM mode.

<DT>Device type code
<DD> <CODE>/CAnon</CODE> or <CODE>/BCAnon</CODE> (landscape mode);
<CODE>/VCAnon</CODE> (portrait mode).  Device type <CODE>/CANON</CODE> or <CODE>/VCANON</CODE> uses
vector instructions for printing, while
type <CODE>/BCANON</CODE> produces a bitmap. The default bitmap size is 1556
blocks and takes 5 min (parallel) or 15 min (serial 9600 baud) to print. 
Thus for simple line graphs <CODE>/CANON</CODE> produces much smaller files
(typically &lt;100 blocks) that that plot in &lt;30 sec.  However, for
complex graphs, for example those obtained with <CODE>PGGRAY</CODE>, <CODE>/BCANON</CODE> will
produce the smaller file and plot faster.  

<DT>Default file name
<DD> <CODE>PGPLOT.CAN</CODE>.

<DT>Default view surface dimensions
<DD> 24 cm by 19 cm (landscape);
19 cm by 24 cm (portrait).

<DT>Resolution
<DD> 300 pixels per inch in both directions.

<DT>Color capability
<DD> Color indices 0 (erase) and 1 (black) are
supported.  Note: hardware polygon fill is used and colors
0--11 control the fill pattern.

<DT>Input capability
<DD> None.

<DT>File format
<DD> Variable length records with Carriage control
of LIST.

<DT>Obtaining hardcopy <DD> If printer is connected to a terminal line
(RS-232 option) then printing the file on the corresponding queue
should suffice.  If the printer is connected using the Centronics
interface, which appears the to VAX as an LP device, then it is
important to ensure that (1) all 8 bit characters are passed to the
printer (2) lines longer than 132 bytes are not truncated, and (3) no
extra formatting commands (e.g. form-feeds) are sent to the printer.
This can be done with the VMS command:
<PRE>
$ SET PRINT/PASSALL/LOWER/CR <I>device</I>
</PRE>
Note, some interface boards
have a option to append a carriage return after a formfeed or LF
character, it is suggested that this be disabled.  The file should be
printed with the /PASSALL qualifier i.e.,
<PRE>
$ PRINT/PASSALL <I>filename</I>
</PRE>
Note: <CODE>SET PRINT/PASSALL</CODE> and
<CODE>PRINT/PASSALL</CODE> do not do the same things and hence
<CODE>PASSALL</CODE> is required in both locations.
