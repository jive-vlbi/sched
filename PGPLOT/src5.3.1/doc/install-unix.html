<h1>Installation Instructions: UNIX systems</h1>

<h2>PGPLOT 5.3.0</h2>

<p><b>Note:</b> The following instructions refer to two directories,
the <i>distribution (source) directory</i> which will contain the
PGPLOT source code directory tree, and the <i>target directory</i>
in which the machine-specific libraries, data files, and
demonstration programs will be created. It is recommended that you
create new, <i>empty</i> directories for these. They should not be
the same directory. In the examples below, these directories are
named</p>

<p><code>/usr/local/src/pgplot531</code> (distribution directory)
<br>
<code>/usr/local/pgplot</code> (target directory)</p>

<p>but you can use any convenient names. Unusual (root) privileges
are not required to install PGPLOT, assuming you have write access
to the directories. A single distribution directory can be used to
install versions of PGPLOT for different architectures in different
target directories.</p>

<h2>Download the distribution file</h2>

<p>Download the distribution file <a href= 
"../downloads/pgplot531.tar.gz">pgplot531.tar.gz</a>.</p>

<h2>Decompress the files</h2>

<p>Use <code>gunzip</code> and <code>tar</code> to decompress the
archive and extract its contents. This will create directory
<code>pgplot531</code> (and subdirectories) in the current
directory. Make sure that your current directory is where you want to
create the &ldquo;PGPLOT distribution&rdquo; directory tree. e.g.,</p>

<pre>cd /usr/local/src
gunzip -c pgplot531.tar.gz | tar xvof -
</pre>

<p>This example will create <code>/usr/local/src/pgplot531</code> and
subdirectories.</p>

<h2>Create the target directory</h2>

<p>Create a writeable directory in which the PGPLOT library and
associated files will be created. One such directory is needed for
each different operating system and compiler combination (&ldquo;target
system&rdquo;) that you wish to support, e.g.,</p> 

<pre>mkdir /usr/local/pgplot
</pre>

<p>Do not try to create the PGPLOT library in the distribution
directory.</p>

<h2>Select device drivers</h2>

<p>Configure PGPLOT by selecting device drivers from the available
list. First copy the file <code>drivers.list</code> from the
distribution directory to the target directory, and then use a text
editor to select device drivers. This file contains one line for
each available device driver: delete the exclamation mark (!) at
the beginning of the line to include the driver, or ensure that an
exclamation mark is present if you want to exclude the driver. Many
of the drivers can be used only on certain operating systems (see
notes in <code>drivers.list</code>), so include <b>only the drivers
you plan to use</b>. PGPLOT can later be reconfigured by restarting
the installation at this step. Most installations should include:
the null device (/NULL), PostScript printers (/PS, /VPS, /CPS, and
/VCPS), Tektronix terminals (/TEK, /XTERM, and possibly other
variants), and, if the X window system is available on the target,
the X window drivers (/XWINDOW, /XSERVE). You may also wish to include
drivers for GIF files (/GIF, /VGIF) or some of the other printers.</p>

<pre>cd /usr/local/pgplot
cp /usr/local/src/pgplot531/drivers.list .
vi drivers.list         (or use your preferred editor)
</pre>

<blockquote><i>The file <code>drivers.list</code> is already configured
to select the drivers that are useful on most systems, so you should
not have to edit it unless you have special requirements.</i></blockquote>

<p><b>Note:</b> If you select either the Motif widget driver (XMDRIV)
or the Tk/Tcl widget driver (TKDRIV), the installation procedure
will install additional files and demonstration programs. Do not
select these drivers unless you are planning to develop programs
that will use them. For further information see the appropriate
documentation:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="xmdriv.html">XMDRIV</a></li>

<li><a href="tkdriv.html">TKDRIV</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Create the makefile</h2>

<p>The PGPLOT installation procedure for UNIX uses a script, called
<code>makemake</code>, to generate a standard UNIX makefile for
your operating system, compilers, and list of selected PGPLOT
device drivers. Operating-system and compiler information is
obtained from a <i>configuration file</i>. Configuration files are
available for the following systems. If your configuration is not
one of those listed, or if you have trouble using the generated
makefile, see below for information about creating your own
configuration file.</p>

<p>Note that the configuration files are for particular compilers,
on particular operating systems. If, for example, you have set up
your system so that the command <code>f77</code> invokes the GNU
g77 compiler, then you cannot use a configuration file designed
for, say, a SPARC f77 compiler. You will have to create a special
configuration file.</p>

<p>In the following table, Arg#2 is a code for the operating
system, and Arg#3 is a code for the Fortran and C compilers. For
more information about the supported systems, see the file <code>
pgplot/sys_*/aaaread.me</code>, where * stands for one of the
options for Arg#2.</p>

<pre>
    Arg#2   Arg#3
    ------  ------
    aix     xlf_cc
    alliant fortran_cc
    bsd     g77_gcc
    convex  fc_cc
    cray    cf77_cc
    epix2   f77_cc         (Control Data EP/IX 2.x)

    fujitsu uxpm_frt_cc
    fujitsu uxpv_frt_cc
    hp      fort77_c89
    hp      fort77_gcc
    irix    f77_cc
    linux   absoft_gcc
    linux   f77_gcc
    linux   g77_elf
    linux   g77_gcc
    next    af77_cc
    next    f2c_cc
    next    g77_cc
    next    gf77_cc
    osf1    f77_cc

    sol2    f77_cc         (Solaris 2.x, SunOs 5.x)
    sol2    f77_gcc
    sol2    f90_cc
    sol2    g77_gcc
    sun4    f77_acc        (SunOS 4.x)
    sun4    f77_cc
    sun4    f77_gcc
    ultrix  f77_cc
</pre>

<p>If your system is one of those listed, proceed as follows:</p>

<p>Make the target directory your current default directory,
e.g.,</p>

<pre>cd /usr/local/pgplot
</pre>

<p>Execute the script <code>makemake</code> from the distribution
directory: e.g., </p>

<pre>/usr/local/src/pgplot531/makemake  /usr/local/src/pgplot531  sun4
</pre>

<p>The first argument supplied to <code>makemake</code> is the name of
the distribution directory. Note that when you run
<code>makemake</code>, your current default directory should be the
target directory, i.e., the directory in which you want to put the
compiled library.</p>

<p>The second argument is the name of the operating system (Arg#2
from the above table); if you omit it or supply an unrecognized
name, makemake will indicate the allowed values.</p>

<p>On some operating systems, where more than one Fortran or C
compiler is available, a third argument is required (Arg#3 from the
above table); usually this is composed of the two compiler names
separated by an underscore. If you omit it, makemake will indicate
the allowed values.</p>

<p>Once you have supplied valid arguments, makemake may complain
that it can't find the <code>drivers.list</code> file. Go back to
step 4!</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<pre>
% ../pgplot531/makemake ../pgplot531 sol2 f77_gcc
For additional information, read file ../pgplot/sys_sol2/aaaread.me
Reading configuration file: ../pgplot/sys_sol2/f77_gcc.conf
Selecting uncommented drivers from ./drivers.list
Found drivers GIDRIV NUDRIV PPDRIV PSDRIV TKDRIV TTDRIV WDDRIV XMDRIV XWDRIV
Creating make file: makefile
Determining object file dependencies.
%
</pre>

<p>The script <code>makemake</code> generates a file <code>
makefile</code> for subsequent use, a Fortran file <code>
grexec.f</code> that calls the selected device drivers, and a text
file <code>rgb.txt</code> that contains color definitions for use
by routine PGSCRN. (If you already have a file <code>
rgb.txt</code>, possibly modified with your own custom definitions,
<code>makemake</code> does not modify it.) It also copies two
Fortran include files that will be needed during compilation. So at
this stage you will have at least the following files:</p>

<pre>
    drivers.list
    grexec.f
    grpckg1.inc
    makefile
    pgplot.inc
    rgb.txt 
</pre>

<p>You should check that these files have been created, and you should
also check that the list of drivers that <code>makemake</code> says
that it found corresponds to those you selected in
<code>drivers.list</code>.</p>

<p>If your UNIX system is not one of the supported systems listed
above, create your own configuration file in the target directory,
with name <code>local.conf</code>. It is best to copy one of the
configuration files provided (from <code>
pgplot/sys_*/*.conf</code>, and then edit it following the comments
in the file. The <code>makemake</code> procedure will use <code>
local.conf</code> if it exists in the current directory, and if you
do not specify Arg#3. Note that you must still specify Arg#2
(operating system). For more information about configuration files,
see <a href="porting.html"><i>Porting PGPLOT</i></a>, or consult <a
href="mailto:tjp&middot;astro.caltech.edu">tjp&middot;astro.caltech.edu</a>. 

<h2>Use <em>make</em> to compile the code</h2>

<p>Now use the UNIX <code>make</code> command to compile the PGPLOT
library following the instructions in <code>makefile</code>:</p>

<pre>make
</pre>

<p>By default, <code>make</code> will generate: an object-module
library, <code>libpgplot.a</code>; a shareable library (if possible
on the selected operating system), the binary PGPLOT font file
<code>grfont.dat</code>, the demonstration programs <code>
pgdemo*</code>, and a documentation file <code>pgplot.doc</code>.
In addition, if the /XWINDOW and/or /XSERVE driver was selected in step
4, it will generate a program <code>pgxwin_server</code>, and if
the /XDISP driver was selected, it will generate a program <code>
pgdisp</code>.</p>

<p>If this step proceeds satisfactorily, you may want to type</p>

<pre>make clean
</pre>

<p>to remove unneeded intermediate files. You will then have the
following files in the current directory:</p>

<pre>drivers.list
grexec.f
grfont.dat            (binary font file)*
libpgplot.a           (PGPLOT library)*
libpgplot.so          (shared library, optional)*
makefile
pgdemo1 ... pgdemo16  (demonstration programs)
pgdisp                (required by /XDISP driver)*
pgplot.doc            (ASCII documentation file)
pgxwin_server         (required by /XWINDOW driver)*
rgb.txt               (color name database)*
</pre>

<p>If you requested XMDRIV or TKDRIV, you will also have some of the
following files:</p>

<pre>pgmdemo                 (executable demo program)
libXmPgplot.a           (object library required by PGPLOT/Motif applications)*
XmPgplot.h              (header file required by PGPLOT/Motif applications)*
libtkpgplot.a           (object library required by PGPLOT/Tk applications)*
pgtkdemo                (executable demo program)
pgtkdemo.tcl            (script used by demo program)
tkpgplot.h              (header file required by PGPLOT/Tk applications)*
</pre>

<p>If you want to copy the compiled version of PGPLOT to another
directory, you must copy at least the files marked with an asterisk
(*). The documentation file contains the PGPLOT subroutine
descriptions, which are also available in the manual.</p>

<h2>Install the C binding</h2>

<p>Optionally, install and test the C binding for PGPLOT. This
requires an ANSI C compiler (that understands function prototypes)
and is not available on all systems.</p>

<pre>make cpg
</pre>

<p>This creates three files:</p>

<pre>cpgplot.h       (ANSI C header file)
libcpgplot.a    (library containing the C binding)
cpgdemo         (demonstration program)
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> The installation procedure does not create a shared
library for the C binding. If you want one, you can create it by
hand using the appropriate commands for your system, e.g. for some
versions of Linux,</p>

<pre>ld -shared -o libcpgplot.so --whole-archive libcpgplot.a
</pre>

<h2>Run the demonstration programs</h2>

<p>Run the demonstration programs on your selected devices and verify
that they run satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Before running any PGPLOT program, you must ensure that the
environment variable <code>PGPLOT_DIR</code> is correctly defined.
This is the name of the directory in which PGPLOT will look for the
files <code>grfont.dat</code> and <code>rgb.txt</code> (unless
environment variables <code>PGPLOT_FONT</code> and <code>
PGPLOT_RGB</code> are defined to override this default behavior),
and, if needed, the X-window server program <code>
pgxwin_server</code>:</p>

<pre>UNIX csh:   setenv PGPLOT_DIR /usr/local/pgplot/
UNIX sh:    PGPLOT_DIR="/usr/local/pgplot/"; export PGPLOT_DIR
</pre>

<p>It is also convenient, but not essential, to define a default
PGPLOT device with environment variable <code>PGPLOT_DEV</code>,
e.g.</p> 

<pre>UNIX csh:   setenv PGPLOT_DEV      /xwindow
</pre>

<p>Other PGPLOT environment variables are described in the <a href="user-manual.html">User Manual</a>.</p>

<p>When using a UNIX shared library (e.g., on Solaris 2.x), you may
also need to put the PGPLOT directory in your loader search path,
defined in environment variable <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.</p>

<p>To run a program, type its name (with directory if the current
directory is not in your path):</p>

<pre>./pgdemo1
</pre>

<p>All he demonstration programs prompt for a device name and type.
Type a question mark <code>?</code> to see a list of the available
device types and verify that PGPLOT has been configured properly.</p>

<p>Points to check for: the PGPLOT program correctly reads the font
file and displays superscripts, subscripts and special characters
(pgdemo2); the PGPLOT program can read the color database
(pgdemo10); on interactive devices, the cursor works correctly
(pgdemo5, pgdemo6).</p>

<p>To test the PGPLOT Motif widget driver, run <code>pgmdemo</code>
in the same way as the other demonstration programs. You must first
ensure that an X-window display is available and that environment
variable <code>PGPLOT_DIR</code> is correctly defined.</p>

<p>To test the PGPLOT Tk/Tcl widget driver, type</p>

<pre>pgtkdemo pgtkdemo.tcl
</pre>

<p>See the <a href="tkdriv.html">documentation</a> for the driver for
more information.</p>

<p><small><b>Note:</b> The installation procedure does not install
the Tk demo correctly on Digital Unix (4.0B). The demos program
pgtkdemo is unable to read command-line arguments. Use the
following commands to compile and link the demo:</small></p>

<pre>cc -c -I`pwd` -I/usr/local/include pgtkdemo.c
cc -o pgtkdemo pgtkdemo.o -L`pwd` -ltkpgplot -lcpgplot -lpgplot \
     -L/usr/local/shlib/alpha -ltk -ltcl -lX11 -lUfor -lfor -lm
</pre>

<small>(i.e., omit -Dmain=MAIN__ and use cc instead of f77 for the
link step.)</small> 

<h2>Install documentation file (optional)</h2>

<p>The standard installation procedure creates an ASCII text file
containing synopses of all the PGPLOT subroutines: <code>
pgplot.doc</code>.</p>

<p>HTML documentation for PGPLOT is include in the
distribution in directory <code>pgplot531/doc</code>.</p>

<h2>Install the library of obsolete routines (optional)</h2>

<p>The library <code>libpgobs.a</code> includes some obsolete PGPLOT
routines. If you have old programs that use these routines, you can
install the library by </p>

<pre>make libpgobs.a
</pre>

<p>However, these routines will not be included in future versions of
PGPLOT, so you should rewrite your programs to avoid their use.</p>
