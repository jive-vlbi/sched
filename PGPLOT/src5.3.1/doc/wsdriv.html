<H2>VMS Workstations Running VWS software</H2>
<DL>

<DT>Supported device
<DD>This driver should work with all VAX/VMS 
workstations running VWS software; it requires the UISSHR
shareable image provided by DEC.

<DT>Device type code
<DD><CODE>/WS</CODE>.

<DT>Default device name
<DD><CODE>PGPLOT</CODE>.  Output is always directed to device 
<CODE>SYS$WORKSTATION</CODE>; the ``device name'' provided by the user is used to 
label the PGPLOT window.

<DT>Default view surface dimensions
<DD>Depends on monitor.
PGPLOT uses a window which is nominally 11 inches wide by 8.5 inches
tall, i.e., the same size as you would get in a hardcopy. If you
prefer a vertical orientation, execute the following command before
running the program: 
<PRE>
$ DEFINE PGPLOT_WS_ASPECT PORTRAIT 
</PRE>
Substitute <CODE>LANDSCAPE</CODE> for <CODE>PORTRAIT</CODE> to revert to horizontal
orientation. 

<DT>Resolution
<DD>Depends on monitor.

<DT>Color capability
<DD>VAX workstations can have 1, 4, or 8 bitplanes.
On 1-plane devices, there are only two colors (background = white,
color index 1 = black). On 4-plane devices, color indices 0--11
are available (4 indices are reserved for text windows and pointers).
On 8-plane systems, color indices 0--249 are available (6 indices
are reserved for text windows and pointers).

<DT>Input capability
<DD>The cursor is controlled by the mouse or the keypad
available on the controlling (DEC-like) keyboard. The user positions 
the cursor, and then types any key on the controlling keyboard.
The mouse buttons are ignored (at present).
