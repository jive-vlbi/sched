<h2>PGPLOT version 5.1.1</h2>

<h3>Tested Systems</h3>

Version 5.1.1 has been tested with the following operating systems
and compilers. Drivers tested include: GI, GL, NU, PP, PS, TT, VT,
WD, X2, XM, XW (but not all combinations of drivers and systems
have been tested exhaustively). 

<ul>
<li><b>SunOS 4.1.3_U1</b>, Sun Fortran (f77) 1.3.1, GNU C (gcc)
2.7.0 (tested on SPARC 5).</li>

<li><b>Solaris 2.5</b> (SunOS 5.5), Sun Fortran (f77) 3.0.1, Sun C
(cc) 3.0.1 (tested on SPARC IPX).</li>

<li><b>Solaris 2.5</b> (SunOS 5.5), Sun Fortran (f77) 3.0.1, GNU C
(gcc) 2.7.2 (tested on SPARC IPX, SPARC Ultra-1).</li>

<li><b>OpenVMS AXP V6.1</b>, DEC FORTRAN V6.2, DEC C V4.0,
DECwindows Motif 1.1 (tested on DEC 3000/M600).</li>

<li><b>OpenVMS VAX V6.1</b>, DEC FORTRAN V6.2, DEC C V4.0,
DECwindows Motif 1.2 (tested on VAXstation 4000-90).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in Version 5.1.1</h3>

All changes are bug fixes or minor improvements. The most notable
bug fixes are: 

<ul>
<li>PGOPEN, PGBEG: a device specification like '? ' (question mark
with one or more trailing spaces) causes PGOPEN to issue a blank
prompt for device specification. This was an unintended change in
5.1.0, and has been fixed in version 5.1.1.</li>

<li>PGBEG: in version 5.1.0, the ordering of panels changed from
row order to column order. The way the sign of the NXSUB argument
was interpreted was precisely the opposite of the documented
interpretation (NXSUB &gt; 0 should give row order, and &lt; 0
should give column order). PGSUBP has always been wrong, but PGBEG
acquired the incorrect behavior in version 5.1.0. Both PGBEG and
PGSUBP now behave as documented.</li>

<li>The PostScript driver was ignoring environment variables used
to set the paper size. It now recognizes these variables. In
addition, it will accept requests via routine PGPAP to change the
paper size, even if the size requested is larger than the default
size. (You can still set the default size with environment
variables PGPLOT_PS_WIDTH and PGPLOT_PS_HEIGHT.) There are two
side-effects of this change: (1) When PGPAP is used, a
portrait-mode graph is placed in the lower left corner of the paper
(offset by the amount specified by environment variables
PGPLOT_PS_HOFFSET and PGPLOT_PS_VOFFSET; a landscape-mode graph is
placed in the same corner of the paper, but in this case it appears
to be the top left corner! (2) When PGPAP is used, the bounding-box
cannot be guessed when the file is opened, so you should not use
the PGPLOT_PS_BBOX environment variable; if you do not set this
variable, a correct bounding box will be written in the file
trailer (see the discussion in the note on <a href="psdriv.html">
the PostScript printer driver</a>).</li>
</ul>

<dt><b>pgplot/drivers</b></dt>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>psdriv.f</dt>

<dd>Bug fixes: PGPLOT_PS_HOFFSET and PGPLOT_PS_VOFFSET were not
decoded correctly (bug introduced in v5.1.0); bounding box could be
incorrect (probably only on systems with non-static allocation of
Fortran variables). Driver now honors all requests to change the
paper size with PGPAP. Optimization: suppressed attempts to draw
zero-length continuation line segments (thanks to Remko
Scharroo).</dd>

<dt>vtdriv-vms.f</dt>

<dd>This is an alternative to vtdriv.f. It uses VMS-specific
Fortran, but may work better than vtdriv.f on VMS systems.</dd>

<dt>xwdriv.c, pgxwin_server.c</dt>

<dd>Bug fix: images were displayed incorrectly on (some?) X-servers
with more than 8 bits per pixel.</dd>
</dl>

<dt><b>pgplot/examples</b></dt>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>pgdemo2.f</dt>

<dd>Added example of Cyrillic text on page 3.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt><b>pgplot/src</b></dt>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>grdtyp.f, grpars.f</dt>

<dd>Bug fix: improved minmatch routine for device types to allow,
e.g., /HPGL even if /HPGL2 is also an option.</dd>

<dt>grpocl.f</dt>

<dd>Bug fix: (this is a support routine for polygon fill with
PGPOLY, etc.) A polygon with one vertex exactly aligned with the
edge of the window was not clipped correctly (thanks to Remko
Scharroo for the bug fix).</dd>

<dt>pgopen.f</dt>

<dd>Bug fix and improvement in header comments. V5.1.0 introduced a
bug: a device argument of '? ' with one or more trailing spaces did
not issue the correct prompt.</dd>

<dt>pgqinf.f</dt>

<dd>Change version to 5.1.1.</dd>

<dt>pgsave.f</dt>

<dd>Correction in header comments.</dd>

<dt>pgsubp.f</dt>

<dd>This routine was interpreting a negative NXSUB argument
incorrectly. According to the documentation, positive NXSUB should
step through the panels in row order, while negative NXSUB should
step through them in column order; but the routine was interpreting
positive NXSUB as column order and negative as row order. The
behavior has been corrected to match the documentation. (In version
5.1.0, pgbeg was changed to call pgsubp, thus introducing this bug
in pgbeg as well.)</dd>

<dt>pgtbox.f</dt>

<dd>The positioning of labels relative to the axis has been
improved; the displacement of labels from the axis should now be
the same as in PGBOX. Problems were most noticeable when a large
character size was requested. (Thanks to Neil Killeen for the
fix.)</dd>

<dt>pgvect.f</dt>

<dd>The routine was ignoring the first row and column of the array
when finding the scale-factor for the vector length. (Thanks to
David Singleton for pointing this out.)</dd>
