<H2>PGPLOT: CGM file format</H2>

<P>CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a standard, device-independent
graphics file format (ANSI/ISO 8632, 1991). It is a vector format, so
files can be scaled without loss of resolution, and some editing is
possible.</P>

<P>Two PGPLOT device types are supported by this driver: CGM and CGMD.
The two differ in the way colors are represented. CGM uses the
indexed method, representing colors using index values and a color
table. CGMD on the other hand, uses direct color representation,
whereby each color reference is stored as a combination of RGB
values.  Generally both CGM and CGMD should produce identical output,
with CGM producing slightly smaller files. However not all software
supports the indexed color selection method. Therefore if color
problems occur when displaying CGM output CGMD should be used instead.</P>

<P>Computer Graphics Metafiles offer many advantages over other file
formats currently supported by PGPLOT:
<UL>

<LI>As CGM is an international standard, it is supported by a great
number of application programs on many different platforms.

<LI>Metafiles, unlike bitmaps (GIF, BMP etc.) do not loose detail and
look blocky when re-sized. This is because rather than storing the
actual image, information is stored which allows the picture to be
re-drawn at any physical size. This makes them ideal for storing
pictures which are comprised of lines and other simple shapes, such as
scientific plots.  

<LI>With this driver full 256 color plots can be
accurately stored as CGM files. Even cell-arrays can be handled,
although these can cause files to become somewhat large.

<LI>CGM files can be imported into the popular Microsoft Office suite
(under Windows, but not MacOS). In MS Word or PowerPoint an imported
picture can be interactively resized and edited without losing detail
or resolution. The color of individual lines can also be changed to
suit the style of the document or presentation.
An imported CGM image is visible on screen in most applications, unlike a
PostScript image which can only be seen when printed.

<P><DT><B>Device type code</B>
<DD>
<CODE>/CGM</CODE> (indexed color mode).
<BR>
<CODE>/CGMD</CODE> (direct color mode).

<P><DT><B>Default file name</B>
<DD>
<CODE>pgplot.cgm</CODE><BR>
The standard extension for CGM files is <code>.cgm</code>.

<P><DT><B>Default view surface dimensions</B>
<DD>
Width 7.8 inch by height 10.5 inch. These defaults can be overridden by
calling <A HREF="subroutines.html#PGPAP">PGPAP</A>.

<P><DT><B>Resolution</B>
<DD>
PGPLOT uses an addressing resolution of 1000 units per inch. The
actual resolution is set by the display device. Metric scaling is
included. If this is supported by the application then imported
pictures appear exactly as created, i.e. a 2-inch plot will be exactly
2inch on screen. (Microsoft Office programs do not recognize this
information.)

<P><DT><B>Color capability</B>
<DD>
Color indices 0-255 are accepted, with standard defaults for color
indices 0-15 (white background, color index 1 = black). For /CGM, if
the color representation of a color index is changed, it affects all
elements drawn in that color on the current page. For /CGMD, changes
in color representation affect only elements drawn after the change.

<P><DT><B>Input capability</B>
<DD>None.

<P><DT><B>File format</B>
<DD>
PGPLOT uses the binary encoding for CGM files, and conforms to
version 1 of the CGM specification.

<P><DT><B>Known Problems</B>
<DD>
        <strong>Plots look chunky and of a
            low resolution when imported into an application.</strong>
            <em>This is because the application uses abstract
            scaling. To overcome this problem make the plot
            larger and it will then appear at a higher
            resolution, but at the same physical size.</em>
        <br><strong>Colors look wrong or the
            picture simply is not visible.</strong> <em>This is
            because you have used the /CGM device to create the
            file, but the application does not understand indexed
            color selection. To overcome this use /CGMD instead.</em>
        <br><strong>A file takes a long time to
            load or causes the application to crash.</strong> <em>This
            is caused by files which have become extremely large,
            usually when cell-arrays are present. The only
            solution to this problem is to consider using a
            different file format, e.g. a bitmap format such as
            GIF.</em>
        <br><strong>A picture cannot be edited by
            an application.</strong> <em>This is due to the fact
            that large files, containing many separate drawing
            elements, are too large for applications like Word or
            PowerPoint to convert completely. They can still be
            re-sized and included normally, but cannot be edited.</em>
