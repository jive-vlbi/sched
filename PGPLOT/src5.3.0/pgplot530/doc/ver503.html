<h2>PGPLOT version 5.0.3</h2>

<h3>Tested Systems</h3>

Version 5.0.3 has been tested with the following operating systems
and compilers. Drivers tested include: GI, GL, NU, PP, PS, TT, VT,
WD, X2, XW (but not all combinations of drivers and systems have
been tested exhaustively). 

<ul>
<li><b>HP-UX version A.09.01</b>, HP Fortran/9000 (fort77), HP C
(c89).</li>

<li><b>OpenVMS AXP V6.1</b>, DEC FORTRAN V6.2, DEC C V4.0 (tested
on DEC 3000/M600).</li>

<li><b>OpenVMS VAX V6.1</b>, DEC FORTRAN V6.2, DEC C V4.0 (tested
on VAXstation 4000-90). <i>Note: the PGDISP server cannot be
compiled on this system.</i></li>

<li><b>Solaris 2.4</b> (SunOS 5.4), Sun Fortran 2.0.1, Sun C 2.0.1
(tested on SPARCstation 10).</li>

<li><b>SunOS 4.1.4</b>, Sun Fortran 1.3.1, cc (tested on
SPARCstation IPX). <i>Note: the C-binding cannot be compiled with
this non-ANSI C compiler.</i></li>

<li><b>SunOS 4.1.4</b>, Sun Fortran 1.3.1, GNU gcc v2.7.0 (tested
on SPARCstation IPX).</li>

<li><b>IRIX 6.0.1</b>, Power Indigo2, f77 -mips4, cc -64 (reported
by Tomasz Plewa).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in Version 5.0.3</h3>

Routine PGQCS has a new option to determine the character height in
world coordinates, and a bug that would give wrong values on
devices with non-square pixels has been corrected. 

<p>Routine PGTBOX has a new option `X' to label the HH field modulo
24. Thus, a label such as 25h 10m would come out as 1h 10m.</p>

<p>Graphical output from the GIF and PPM drivers can now be
directed to the standard output by specifying a file name ``-'',
e.g., ``-/gif''. This allows output to be piped to a viewing
program, e.g., ``<code>pgprog | xv -</code>''. This will only work
for single-page plots.</p>

<p>In this version I have started work to change the character
coding of PGPLOT text strings from US-ASCII to ISO Latin-1.
Unfortunately I do not have digitized versions of most of the
required glyphs, so this work is not complete. Programs which use
characters with decimal codes in the range 128-255 will now display
differently: in most cases, the glyph will be an approximation to
the ISO Latin-1 character (e.g., an unaccented letter instead of
the correctly accented one).</p>

<p>A new escape sequence, <code>\.</code>, has been added for a
centered dot (&middot;).</p>

<p>A bug has been fixed that affected PostScript and possibly some
other drivers: they would ignore a change to the
color-representation of the currently selected color index.</p>

<p>Some changes have been made in the way PGPLOT writes BoundingBox
comments in PostScript files.</p>

<p>Two bugs in polygon fill have been fixed: PGPOLY would issue an
error message about a polygon with less than 3 vertices on some
occasions when a polygon was completely outside the viewport; and
polygon fill was ignored completely on some devices if the y-axis
ran downwards instead of upwards.</p>

<p>There is one new driver (HGDRIV), for HP-GL/2 devices.</p>

<p>Minor corrections have been made in several other subroutines
and text files.</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>aaaread.me</dt>

<dd>Changed version number to 5.0.3.</dd>

<dt>copyright.notice</dt>

<dd>Changed version number to 5.0.3.</dd>

<dt>drivers.list</dt>

<dd>Added HGDRIV.</dd>

<dt>install.txt</dt>

<dd>Updated.</dd>

<dt>makehtml</dt>

<dd>This is a <code>perl</code> script used for making the html
documentation file. Some systems had trouble executing this script.
I have now modified it to invoke <code>perl</code> by the <code>
#!</code> mechanism. You may have to modify the first line of the
script to specify the location of <code>perl</code> on your
system.</dd>

<dt>makemake</dt>

<dd>Now includes the ``non-standard'' routines in the documentation
files (pgplot.doc, pgplot.html). Also modified the non-standard
routines to get cross-references to their aliases in the HTML file.
The list of include file dependencies is now generated by searching
the code. Special code for the Motif widget has been added. Added
HGDRIV.</dd>

<dt>ver503.txt</dt>

<dd>(New file.) Release notes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt><b>pgplot/drivers</b></dt>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>hgdriv.f</dt>

<dd>(New file.) Driver from Colin J. Lonsdale for HP-GL/2 devices.
I have not tested this. It is an alternative to GLDRIV: you should
probably not include both in your PGPLOT configuration.</dd>

<dt>lxdriv.f</dt>

<dd>Removed a non-standard DATA initialization.</dd>

<dt>psdriv.f</dt>

<dd>Changed interpretation of environment variables <code>
PGPLOT_PS_BBOX</code> and <code>PGPLOT_PS_DRAW_BBOX</code>; see the
<a href="psdriv.html">documentation</a>.</dd>

<dt>xwdriv.c</dt>

<dd>Fix an error in display of large images.</dd>

<dt>gidriv.f, ppdriv.f, wddriv.f</dt>

<dd>Added comments to indicate what must be changed on operating
systems like OSF/1 that use 64-bit addresses.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt><b>pgplot/examples</b></dt>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>pgdemo1.f</dt>

<dd>Fixed error in scatter plot, and rewrote random number
routines.</dd>

<dt>pgdemo2.f</dt>

<dd>Exercise a few more escape sequences.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt><b>pgplot/src</b></dt>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>grdtyp.f, grldev.f</dt>

<dd>Changed to totally ignore a PGPLOT driver that reports a
zero-length device type. This is to allow for stub drivers (more to
come on this).</dd>

<dt>grfa.f</dt>

<dd>Fix bug: polygon fill was ignored on devices for which fill
must be emulated in PGPLOT if the y-axis was reversed.</dd>

<dt>grfa.f, grrec0.f</dt>

<dd>Changed to avoid use of a real variable as a do-loop index (not
allowed by some compilers).</dd>

<dt>grscr.f</dt>

<dd>Fix bug that affected some drivers: if you change the color
representation of the current color, these drivers did not
notice.</dd>

<dt>grsyds.f</dt>

<dd>Changed to allow 304 = 256+48 characters in a font rather than
128+48 (the `48' are the greek characters). Added <code>\.</code>
escape sequence.</dd>

<dt>grsymk.f</dt>

<dd>Changed to allow 304 = 256+48 characters in a font rather than
128+48. This is in preparation for using the ISO-Latin-1 character
set rather than US-ASCII. Unaccented glyphs have been assigned for
most of the ISO-Latin-1 accented characters.</dd>

<dt>pgcl.f</dt>

<dd>Under rare circumstances could crash with <i>both arguments to
atan2 equal to zero</i>. [This is an internal routine used by
PGCONL].</dd>

<dt>pgpoly.f</dt>

<dd>Fixed a bug in the clipping algorithm that affected some
polygons that lie entirely outside the viewport.</dd>

<dt>pgqcs.f</dt>

<dd>Added option UNITS=4 to determine the character height in world
coordinates, and fixed a bug that would give wrong values on
devices with non-square pixels.</dd>

<dt>pgqhs.f</dt>

<dd>Corrected comments (arguments are output, not input).</dd>

<dt>pgqinf.f</dt>

<dd>Changed version number to 5.0.3. Changed cursor test to
determine whether the driver reports a cursor, rather than assuming
that all interactive devices have cursors.</dd>

<dt>pgtbox.f</dt>

<dd>New option `X' to label the HH field modulo 24 [Neil
Killeen].</dd>

<dt>pgimag.f</dt>

<dd>Minor changes to header comments.</dd>

<dt>pgswin.f, pgwnad.f</dt>

<dd>These routines now check whether a window of zero width or zero
height has been requested, in order to prevent a nasty
divide-by-zero error.</dd>

<dt>pg*.f (many files)</dt>

<dd>Many of the top-level PG routines have been modified to issue a
warning message (by calling PGNOTO) if no device is open. This is
in preparation for multiple open devices.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt><b>pgplot/sys</b></dt>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>grfileio.c</dt>

<dt><b>pgplot/sys_dos</b></dt>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>msdriv.f</dt>

<dd>Revised device driver for PCs running DOS with Microsoft
Fortran 5.0, from Harry Lehto. This replaces msdriv.f,
msdriv.koyama, and msdriv.lehto.</dd>
</dl>

Toby].</dd>

<dt><b>pgplot/sys_osf1</b></dt>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>aaaread.me</dt>

<dd>Added notes about the 64-bit address problem: some PGPLOT
device drivers must be modified to be used with this operating
system.</dd>

<dt>grgmem.c</dt>

<dd>This is a variant of pgplot/sys/grgmem.c that returns the
