There are two versions of modified .conf files here.   One uses the default 
gfortran.  And one is for use at the AOC where one must point to a specific
one to get a version high enough to use with some of the code.  The latter
is the one with gccsp in it.  The latter is invoked for makemake by specifying
gfortran_gccsp as the third argument.  See domakemake.
