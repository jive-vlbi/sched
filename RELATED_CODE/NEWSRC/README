NEWSRC is a program for updating the SCHED source catalogs based
on new solutions.  The main providers of such solutions are
GSFC and Leonid Petrov.  See the code for more details.

I still have the working areas elsewhere because of the bulk.
Code and data here can end up in the export files.  As of this 
writing, the working areas are in 
/home/noatak/cwalker/code/Calibration/GetCatalogs
Note /home/noatak/cwalker is NOT ~cwalker (which is on filehost).
