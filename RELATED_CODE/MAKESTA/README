MAKESTA is a very slight variation of MAKESETUP.

The only changes relative to MAKESETUP are to the include file and
getdat.f.  The dimensions of the arrays are switched from being
oriented to many small output files to one very large one.  In getdat,
the input file is renamed to something appropriate for the stations
catalog.  The code in code/makesetup should be considered to be the
master and any real changes should be made there.


(This added Mar. 15, 2014) MAKEST is apparently meant to be used to
try to simplify the construction of the station catalog in much the
same way that MAKESETUP simplifies construction of large numbers of
setup files.  But I don't think it was ever used.  Certainly it
is not being used as of this writing.
