****  WARNING ABOUT DELETES **** 
There are some setup files that are not built with
this mechanism.  They are mer*.set, lba*.set.  Do not delete them if
cleaning out the files produced by this protram.
*********************************


   29 Mar 1995.  Add some Effelsberg VLBA parameters.  Avoid 1:4 2bit 
                 pol.  Get rid of LO offsets.  RCW
   8 May 1995    Allow 1:4 2bit single pol. (Modes 64-2-2 and 128-4-2) 
                 RCW.
   26 Feb 1996   Put back 16 track barrel roll on unity speed up obs. 
                 RCW
   13 Apr 1996   Removed tape speed.  Allow default.
   15 Nov 1996   Major changes reflecting new defaulting capabilities
                 in SCHED.
   26 Mar 1997   Add Mark IV and S2 stations.
   12 Jun 1997   Add a lot of Mark IV stuff and utilize big 
                 modifications to makesetup and some changes to SCHED.
   14 Jul 1997   Add 512 Mbps modes.
    8 Aug 1997   Roll off in vsop modes.
   30 Sep 1997   Alter vsop18cmvla frequencies.
   20 Apr 1998   Add EVN/MERLIN standard 18 cm modes.  Check some others 
                 against current EVN codes.sch.  Didn't have the patience
                 to check all the odd ones.
   28 Aug 2007   Add 24 GHz to pointing.
   18 Sep 2008   Remove (comment out) MarkII and MarkIII
   13 Feb 2012   Add a 7mm dummy setup for the RDBE_PFB for reference pointing.
   16 Jan 2013   Actually delete some commented setups (eg M3)
                 Add EVLA pointing setups.  Start on RDBE setups.
   10 Jan 2014   Copy this file to Master_setups_preDDC.
                 Copy current setups to OLD_JAN2014.
                 Then convert all appropriate files to use the DDC.
                 In most cases, this doesn't actually mean much change.
                 One required change is that the offset LO for pulse
                 cal change from 0.99 or 0.49 to 0.75 because of the 
                 combined DDC and legacy system tuning restrictions.
                 Many files deleted.  Can be founs on the copy above if needed.
                 Get rid of 1 bit cases.

Lead comments from makesetup.f:

C     Items in the master file:
C
C     Modes:  Specified between #mode <name> and #end.
C             Inserted as new lines wherever @mode <name> appears 
C             later in file. Modes are meant to be blocks of lines
C     Files:  Specified between #file <name> and #end
C             Causes an output file to be written.
C     Variables: Specified with #<name>.  Everything else on that
C             line up to a ";" or the end of the line is the value.  
C             Other things can be earlier on the line or after the
C             ";".  If the value ends with a comma, the whole next 
C             line will also be included (limit - one extra line).
C             The line or lines will be substituted wherever @<name> 
C             appears.  Anything else on the line with the 
C             $name will be preserved.
C             The variable definition must be specified in the #file 
C             or the modes included in the #file.  However its 
C             position relative to its use does not matter.  Functions
C             may be included in variables.  Of course, #mode and 
C             #file are reserved for invoking modes and files.
C     "if"    ?<name> to ?end is only included if the named variable   
C             is not blank.  These can be anywhere on their lines.
C             and many lines can be included.
C
C     Functions: name ends with (.  Argument list ends with ) and items
C     are separated with blanks.
C     There are a few built in:
C
C        bbc(    Requires a value for NCHAN have been set.
C                5 arguments:  a, bbc(i),i=1,4
C                gives:  bbc(i) = bbc(mod(i,4)+1) + int((i+1)/4)*a
C                Anything beyond the *bbc spec in the line will be lost.
C                Note that SCHED has good BBC defaulting so this is
C                probably no longer needed.
C        side(   Set the sidebands.  Takes 4 arguments such as 
C                'L L U U'.
C                Will repeat that pattern to the number of channels. 
C        foff(   Set the frequency offsets.  3 or 4 arguments.  First 
C                is number of times to repeat each one.  Second is 
C                multiplier of bandwidth for the increment.  Third is
C                the lowest offset.  The optional fourth is the offset
C                of the nchan/2+1 channel (for s/x).
C        freq(   Set the reference frequencies.  If there is one
C                argument, it is all that is given (used for all
C                channels.  If a second is given (eg s/x), it is
C                used for the second half of the channels.
C
C     Lines not in a mode or file will be ignored.
C     Substitution of modes happens whenever the mode request is
C     found.
C
C     The #mode and #file sections can be in any order.  Everything
C     will be read in before anything is written out so any #mode
C     sections will be available for expansion by the time it is
C     needed.  There can be only one instance of each mode or file.
C     Variables can change at any time and the most recently seen
C     one after expansion of the modes will be used.

More mathematical descriptions of the functions:

  function bbc( a bbc(1) bbc(2) bbc(3) bbc(4) )
       bbc(i) = bbc(mod(i,4)+1) + a * int((i-1)/4)
       for i = 5, nchan.
  function side( side(1) side(2) side(3) side(4) )
       side(i) = side( mod(i-1,4 +1 )   
       for i = 5, nchan
  function foff( nrep incr foff1 foff2 )
       foff(i) = foff1 + bw*incr*((i-1)/nrep) for i = 1, nchan/2   
       foff(i) = foff2 + bw*incr*((i-nchan/2-1)/nrep) for i = 2, nchan
       foff2 can be omitted in which case the form for foff1 will 
         apply for all channels.
  function freq( freq1 freq2 ) 
       freq(i) = freq1  for i = 1, nchan/2
       freq(i) = freq2  for i = nchan/2+1, nchan
       Only one value given if freq1=freq2

-------------------------------------------------------------
SCHED DEFAULTS:

      logging  = standard
      ifdist   = 0,0,0,0
      noise    = low-s,low-s,low-s,low-s
      period   = 1  
      level    = -1 
      pcal     = '1MHz'
      bbc      = Appropriate choice with knowledge of MKIV constraints.
      format   = Appropriate for DAR for station from station catalog.
      dbe      = rdbe_ddc for VLBA.  dbbc_ddc for dbbc stations.  Others blank.
      station  = Stations in schedule in scans that use this setup.
      netside  = Depends on DAR and first LO.  For RDBE_DDC, U, U... 
                 unless some station has too few BBCs.
      track1, track2 ... will be set to appropriate values for the mode.
      pcalxb1, pcalxb2, pcalfr1, and pcalfr2:
        Detect the first 16 of the following:
           1.  Lowest frequency pcal tone in each channel - sign bit only.
           2.  Highest frequency pcal tone in each channel - sign bit only.
           3.  State counts - both bits for 2 bit data.
           4.  Pcal tone 1 MHz up from first - sign bit only.
        The net sideband must be known to set pcalfr1 and pcalfr2.  Either
        give it with netside or use FREQREF.  Otherwise only state counts
        will be done.

      if FORMAT=VLBA or MKIV, fan out is picked to give speedup 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------
   USEFUL SCHED CONVENTIONS:

   firstlo, bbfilt, and bits are set all the same if only 1 is given.
       Warning - if all channels were set for one station, they must all
       be set for later stations.

   station=VLBA  works for all VLBA stations.

   FREQUENCY SETTING:  
      The BBC frequencies can be set from:
       1.  BBSYN(ICH) can be set directly.
       2.  BBSYN(ICH) = ABS( FREQREF(ICH) + FREQOFF(ICH) - FIRSTLO(ICH) )
      The BBC sideband can be set from:
       1.  SIDEBAND(ICH) sets it directly.
       2.  It will be deduced from NETSIDE(ICH) and FREQREF(ICH) if
           those are given.
      For nearly all of the standard setups, FREQREF+FREQOFF+NETSIDE 
      will be used and the frequency catalog will be relied upon 
      for FIRSTLO etc.

   MARK III and S2
      Mark III modes removed Sept. 18, 2008.  Mark III is long gone.  RCW.
      S2 removed Jan 10, 2014, to the extent there was any.

   MODES
      Below are a series of "mode"s.  Each either defines a channelization
      and recording mode, or defines the receiver setup and base frequency
      for a band.  Most "file" specifications use one of each.

   Keep lines less than 120 characters long in Master_setup.  Keep less than
   80 characters in the setup files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is the basic shell for all (nearly all) files.
It positions information set with variables elsewhere.
Note that the ?xstation sections are only included if there
are stations of that type.  If they are not included, the format
is all skipped as is best for SCHEDs defaulting.

Makesetup will add a / at the end if there is none.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Removed tape speed/duration information.  RIP tapes.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Basic information including reference frequency and 
station lists for each band.  Also some top-of-file comments.
Note, give two numbers in the definition of @freq.  It they
are different, they are treated appropriately for sx with
equal numbers of channels in each band.

Most frequencies are the old Mark II network standards.

If no stations are given of any type, SCHED will default to
the stations in the schedule.  Also, this will cause FORMAT
not to be specified.

Version to be used for the RDBE_PFB/MARK5C schedule when doing
reference pointing with the old BBCs and old control system
on the VLBA during RDBE_PFB observations.  This ensures 
the RF switches are set right.  Only setting up for 7mm as that
is the band used for reference pointing.    We cannot make line
versions like the above because the PFB can't do it.  Trust to
the CRDBW setting.  And be sure no non-VLBA stations get such

!  Setup for 20cm observations with the RDBE using the PFB personality.
!  There are 2 LO settings on the VLBA for 20cm observations.  

!  With the 2.1 GHz LO, the frequency range tops out at 1600 MHz.  The 
!  bottom is set by the receiver and, at some sites, RFI filters.  
!  See freq_RDBE.dat for details, but expect problems below about 1350 MHz.
!  The top is set by the IF range at most sites.  SC, has an IF-based 
!  665-1027 MHz RFI filter that cuts signals above 1435 MHz (with this LO)
!
!  With the 2.4 GHz LO, the lower frequency limit is 1392 for the PFB (1376 
!  for the DDC).  The top is set by the receiver to around 1850 MHz, with
!  values closer to 1750 MHz for the sites with RFI filters.  Again see
!  freq_RDBE.dat for details.

!  For reasons of RFI, it is generally preferred to use the 2.4 GHz LO over
!  the 2.1 GHz option unless the science absolutely requires going to 
!  lower frequencies.  For this setup, the 2.4 GHz LO is used.

!  The freq_RDBE.dat entry v20cm_2 will be used with firstlo=2400 for the VLBA
!  The GBT uses the same LO so there is a good match.  EB_RDBE has an option
!  to observe in the range 1584 to 1706 MHz with matching PFB channels but
!  sideband inversion has to be used.

!  The following RF frequencies are allowed with the PFB and 2.4 GHz LO.
!  They are the bottom of the 32 MHz bands (bad IF 1040 channel not shown)
!  1392.  1424.  1456.  1488.  1520.  1552.  1584.
!  1616.  1648.  1680.  1712.  1744.  1776.  1808.  1840.

!  Hydrodgen is at 1420.4 MHz.  OH is at 1612.2, 1665.4, 1667.4, and 1720.5 
!  MHz, so those are covered.   Very approximately, the bad RFI regions 
!  for the VLBA are 1525 to 1555 MHz, near 1620 MHz, and 1690 to 1720 MHz.
!  For dual band, we need to leave out 7 of those listed.  Taking into 
!  account the RFI and band edges, and trying to get the spectral lines,
!  Leave out:  1520, 1616, 1680, 1744, 1776, 1808, and 1840
!  Keep:   1392, 1424, 1456, 1488, 1552, 1584, 1648, and 1712
!  Note that this set is not a good match for EB so a separate setup is

!  harmonic of the LO mixing in unwanted signal as described in 
!  freq_RDBE.dat.  Initial tests suggests that this might not be a
!  problem and if that stands up, the low end may be moved back down
!  (it was 3400 in the initial version of this file).
