! Standard setup file: rdbe_pfb_18cm_HSA_dual.set              
!     (Produced by MAKESETUP)
!  Setup for 20cm observations with the RDBE using the PFB personality.
!  This is much like rdbe_pfb_1548_dual.set so see the comments in
!  that file for details.  The difference is that this one is meant
!  for better overlap with EB_RDBE so the list of baseband frequencies
!  is a bit different, with solid coverage in the 1584-1706 range covered
!  at EB_RDBE with a 1056 MHz LO.  Basically, the basebands are split
!  into two chunks, one near 1400 and the other with the EB overlap.
!  Keep:   1392, 1424, 1456, 1488, 1584, 1616, 1648, and 1680
!  But for EB_RDBE, we will need to use dummy basebands at higher
!  frequencies.  Also we need to use sideband inversion.
!  Note that the .sum file will show EB frequencies 32 MHz above those
!  on the other stations because of the different sidebands.  The
!  first 4 polarization pairs at EB correlate with the last 4 at the
!  other stations.
