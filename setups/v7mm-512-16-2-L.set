!      For the 7 mm band.
!        Radio Astronomy allocation:  42400-43500
!        Medicina band 43164-43278
!        Old: freqref  = 43150.75  !  Reasonable Mark II setting.
!        Frequency based on experiments in Feb 95 global session.

!   512 Mbpsf
!   This mode has too many channels for the RDBE_DDC.
!   SCHED will default to the PFB, but then the frequencies
!   and bandwidths will be wrong.
!   It might be useful for other systems.
